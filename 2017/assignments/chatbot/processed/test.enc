Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
There.
You got something on your mind?
I was?
But
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
Where've you been?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
But you hate Joey
You did what?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
You set me up.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
You the new guy?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
What's the worst?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
We don't chat.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
Who's that?
You think this'll work?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
hey.  Great show, huh?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Kat! Wake up!
BIANCA
Good call.
A soft side? Who knew?
So what's your excuse?
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
You up for it?
You know what I mean
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Sweet love, renew thy force!
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
We should have seen land.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
You can see for yourself.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
Are we going to argue?
You don't usually ask.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
I have to explore the mainland.
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
All I have to do is call the guards.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Chief says...
God... That's in a week!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
What are you saying?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
How old are you, Senor Colon?
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
I'm coming with you.
What about Oleg?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What else do you need?
Are you married?
Divorced.
So...the station is empty?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
What about back home?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
Do you have coffee?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
It was my decision, not his.
When?
Yeah.
Who's there?
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
You got any better ideas?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Is it drug related?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Hey, honey.
Stop it.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
You're ruthless.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Answer it.
Thank you.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Where's Czech girl?
Two weeks.
Don't speak Russian!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
What is that?
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Emil???!
I can get you a job.
Robert...?
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Alright.  Go ahead.
A cheap hotel.
That's what it looks like to me.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
How was it?
What the hell happened?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
CONTINUED
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
It's possible.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
But not completely inconceivable?
I guess it isn't.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
Yes, I know.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
That's true
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Name?
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
You lying son of a bitch...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
Yeah.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Now, where we goin', convict?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
They saved your ass, convict.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
What about Luther?
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Do I get to kiss her too?
You okay?
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
What the bell happened?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
When? How?
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Thanks for the coffee.
Hard man to live with.
How much?
What're you laughing about?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
...would you like a drink?
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
When is she not in trouble?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
I don't have time... I need to know.
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
...What's your name?
Have you pulled yourself together?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
To save the world.
And the third one?
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You get that off the screen?
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
It's up to you now, Angel!
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
They just landed in the desert.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
I'm not accusing you...
I love you.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
What happened to you?
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
What are you talking about?
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
What's the problem?
Where are the women?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Don't think I won't.
You're asking me why?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Not quite.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
You're learning.
Where does he sell it?
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
I'm afraid I don't...
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm not positive this means anything.
You're joking.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
You told me to look, so I looked.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
How will I get it to you?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
No.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know.  I think so.
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Those are her belongings.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Then you saw him, too?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
How long have you been awake?
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
Nice neighborhood.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What is it?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I'll tell you later.
I gotta get out of here.
Hey...wake up.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
There you go.  Love you.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
But how are we gonna --
Yeah...
You, too?
My father!  He's not - ?
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
As we near the Pole...
Who with?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
He did!
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
What are you boys up to?
You see it?
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
I used to play ball.
What happened?
Safety on?
No brag. Just fact.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Break stuff?
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
I figured you already heard.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
Yeah, lots.
Good. Who?
For a while.
How's she doing?
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
What way?
Then... I guess you have to.
Strange.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Take care, Wade.
You talked to Jack?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Just do it.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Pop, for Christ's sake!
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
No shit.
How was she?
Wade, are you alright?
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
How was...  ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
I prefered the terrorists.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
Can we do that?
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
About goddamn time.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
*                     Please tell me your name.
My husband is a very courageous man.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
I miss you. And I miss her.
Excuse me?
I might still have a few chips left.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shit.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
What?
That just doesn't make any sense.
I was reading too.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
What is it, Mary?
Oveur.
Sir?
Who's that, Ted?
Elaine!
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Ted, the lever!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Negative.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
Scraps.
Yeah.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
I don't want to live anymore.
You're sure?
No.  Poached.  Over.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
Are you on the Mercury mission?
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Striker.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
Do you want to talk about it.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Elaine!
I love you, Elaine.
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Rats! I've lost number three.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Yes, Captain?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I'm Randy.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Yes?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
That's right.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Here?
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Did you learn anything?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Who said that?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
In the other man's rectum.
Why?
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
We?  You've taken it?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Harcourt is dead.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
What?
HOW MUCH TIME?
Have they located my daughter yet?
Hear me out...
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Sounds like you, Hicks.
I don't want you for a friend.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Look, I told you...
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
Indeed.
Why not?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
No, she's fine.
Is she a good fuck?
What??
I want to go back to Vienna.
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Yes.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
Well, don't do that again!
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
Alone.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
I was at hand.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
Really?
Yes?
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Yes, indeed.
What do you mean, Sire?
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Don't you have a maid?
Yes.
How many?
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Animals?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
I'm afraid I am.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Mio caro Adone.
How could I not?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
You burned the score?
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
What work?
A Mass for the dead.
Shall I answer it?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
Do you have me?
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you have it?
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
No, but I'm the best.
Mozart -
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Did you try?
Yes.
I poisoned his life.
Are you absolutely sure?
Ballet? What ballet?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
I'll call tomorrow.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Dr. Hirsch?
He said 'Jack'.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
What did he say?
Yes.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
No, a cab will be faster.
What shall we do?
I beg your pardon?
Mr. Kessler?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
What?
Not just a patient -- me.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Your dead friend Jack?
I would think so.
The kitchen.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
I was awake and he was in my room.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
David, what are you doing?
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
How are we feeling tonight?
Miss Price.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
Alex?
How long have I been here?
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
I really don't know.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
Nice looking group.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
Say, David...
I heard that.
Yeah?
No, but he was on the moors.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Jack, are you really dead?
What can I say, Jack?
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Oscar, what's the matter?
Matt?
Yes, sir.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
What about?
Say, you can't do that
We've been waiting fifteen minutes
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
know, but
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Doesn't that come next?
Why are you so anxious?
Don't you know?
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Yes, sir.
I'm listening.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
Excuse me
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
Well . . .
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Oh!
Mr. Sampson . . .
You haven't got a uniform?
Why, I don't know.
Yes, sir.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
But I haven't . . .
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
What'll we do?
Absolutely.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
Matt, come here!
What did you do with it?
Oh, ten dollars
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
How are you fixed?
I'm okay, Matt.
This is healing?
Uhh, yeah it does.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
Hey!
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
You shut up now, boy.
Where you boys going?
It's not a bank.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
It'll be the biggest score yet.
A bad idea.
Dammit!
Both would be nice.
The safe. Now.
What is it?
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
They're gone. What are you --
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
What do you think?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
You've killed your fair share of men.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
So what was he?
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
I shouldn't tease a hero.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Not if I find the right girl.
And what's this right girl like?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I swear.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Really?
I hope I'm not being too forward.
What is that?
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
So you can't tell me anything?
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
You just haven't been looking.
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
He's rich.
Can I help you?
No, he doesn't.
Don't come back.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
That's Paul Owen.
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Like what?
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Two at nine? Perfect.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Oh, something. . romantic?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Patrick?
Yes, Patrick?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Who's Ted Bundy?
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Patrick? Is that you?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Welt...it depends, why?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
That's...that's too bad.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Oh no, I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
No, really. I'm okay.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Don.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
I've questioned him.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
I'm hungry.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
...But?
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
What!
What're you -- what?
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
That was -- different.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Look at this.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
He wasn't acting?
My goodness.
What?!
...Hello?
Cool!
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Milo. What's up?
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
What'd the girl say?
What?
Just thought his work should go on.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Did you wanna be alone?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
They'd frame him.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
What'd he say?
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Meet me at the other location.
Latitude 47 degrees.
I met this girl.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
What're they building?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
We won, Austin.
Thank you, Basil.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Yes Basil?
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
My meat and two veg.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
A Chigro?
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
I haven't had fun like that since college.
I can't. You're drunk.
Not in the Nineties.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
What are you saying, son?
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Blow me.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
Great.
Why?
We don't judge here.
Hope...
Mr. John Steed, please.
I have an appointment.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
I resign.
An unholy trinity ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
Valentine, listen to me ...
I had a spot of bother at the door.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Strange.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
To kill me?
Not for a moment.
I'm playing to win.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Aren't you coming?
It's called Black Leather.
What is it?
Where's Mother?
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Makes two of us.
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Weather's turning nasty.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Guilty until proven innocent?
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
I've decided not to run for President.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I don't want any trouble.
Great car.
The best.
I'm going now, Cole.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
That feels so great.
This is it, lady. Last stop.
I hope Ilene's all right.
A real turd.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
That's it, prick lips.
Give him the works.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
You're a pimp?
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
What the hell are you doing?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
The phone made me do it!
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Mrs.?
Where'd she go?
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
-- Knock it off!
Did you do it for Tim?
-- He killed people --
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Hey, what are you doing here?
-- What are you doing here?
Jennifer.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
When I was twenty.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
You think that's really any of your business?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
I was doing my job.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Yes.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
Who's doing this?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Where are you going?
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
And the putty around the door?
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Then who wrote the report?
Did I say thanks?
Your brother was a good man.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Four months?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
I have a job.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Completely out of control.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
What?
So, you surviving without me?
Coffee sucked.
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
Fixing my roof.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
Anyway, down here, take a look...
Didn't think you'd make it.
I'm working on it.
Inspector.
Don't you have any leads at all?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
"The Strawberries"?
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Let me think about it.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
De-la-croix.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
To what?
How you sound?
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
Go on.  Good so far.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
I didn't mean that, in life.
I love you too, Daddy.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
How was it?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
Hello.
This is the group I was telling you about.
Thanks.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
He said that?
Yes he did.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
So what's up with you and DeLa?
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
The one with da big...
No, not that.  How 'bout...
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...perfect...
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
You don't read, do you?
Just ask me what you want to know.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
What is your uncle's name?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Who else can give me information about you?
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
You want my heart?
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Yes?
The milkmaid's daughter?
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
You killed him you fucking faggot --
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
We're not finished yet --
We don't need the tapes --
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Where's the cabin?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
You know it's not like that --
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
If not you, then who?
Mueller.
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
I didn't kill him --
Where are they!
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
I'm sorry, Bill.
What are you talking about?
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
Ah, Christ
We're in the middle of a murder case --
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
I plan to grow on you.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
Buttfucks the cabin?
We're fucked, I know --
You couldn't have known --
We need to talk --
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Who, Levi --
So?
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
Sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
You were expecting me?
What is this place?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Fine, you do it.
You get the eye?
I brought it.
Bloom!
How long have you known my father?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Did you see that woman?
Please. Go. Just go.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
I never knew.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Did you do any of that?
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
So how does it happen?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
How did you get so many?
I was drying out.
This is it? The whole vault.
Oh. Oh.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
You didn't become crazy.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
You don't have to.
That's because most of it never happened.
How did you get here?
We rented a car.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
No I don't.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
Do you like it?
Say thank you.
What? What are you doing?
Leave him!
Right.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
I...
Put the fucking kettle down.
Oh Jesus.
Is that everything?
Syevodnya?
It's makes it easier. Okay.
I don't want to know.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
In the world.
What? No you're not..
Oh Jesus.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
You...
Excuse me?
Get out
What?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
I'm trying to quit.
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
It's not mine either.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
What does it mean?
My name's Sophia.
Thanks.
How do you want to pay?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
That young lady's size, right'cher.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Holy shit.
Sure.
You been home yet?
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
God forgive you, for how you done me...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Let me say somethin' first...
LET ME GO!
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
Let go of me...
You take it straight?
Could you do somethin' for me?
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
Sorry.
Huh?
What'chu sayin'?
Nuh-uh.
How a girl get like that?
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Yes'sir.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
That's right.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You could put it that way.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
Got in a little accident.
The hell are you talkin' about?
Nick... You up?
Hey, when in Rome --
Let's go.
Getting very weird.
What does Charlie mean?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
You'll take care of that.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Give us a break...
How'd you get this?
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
You can't come in.  They don't want --
Where does this Sugai live?
Let's go.  Him first.
No.
We can't lose.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
She ever pull down her shades?
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
Might be different in New York.
Save it, I already took the tour.
She's such a long way home for you.
Yeah.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
Why me?
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
Why tell me this?
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
With these?
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Where?
What's the point?
Then go get him.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
You're our best and only friend.
I think, therefore I am.
Yeah.  I got it.
You equipped for random questions?
I know all that.
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
You like to kiss her goodbye.
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
No.  I got a problem.
You're going to be over the limit.
What did she want?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
What shows?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
I bet I would.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
I'd take him to the doctor.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
What do you want me to do?
Uh-huh.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
But in your profession that is a risk.
Well?
Discreetly.
A tortoise.  What's that?
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
How come you were in my truck?
Pris.
What makes you think so?
Hi!
You like it?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
My office.
How do you do?
No, I'm lost.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
How's that?
No.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
I was wrong!!
Is this your house?
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
About clothing?
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
No!  Not crazy!
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
My pleasure.
Yes, it is.
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
These are wonderful.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
You have very nice ceilings.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Yeah?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I just don't want to.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
The sky!!!
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Hello.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Yes, ma'am.
This is your bedroom?
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
I'm not hungry.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
Oh, no.
If I...you know...
Right here!
What did you wish for, Adam?
--and we will--
You came back for these?
What's that supposed to mean?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Well, what do you think?
Always good advice.
What's that mean?
What's it to you?!
Uh, yes, you do.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Gay.
And if we can't find him?
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
Wolf One -- say intentions.
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
You're all through with this now?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
What do you want from me?
No.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I did. Are you?
I'll call you.
Oh no.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
He's comin' back? What for?
Oh he forced you, huh?
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Yes, but.
Look at these. What are these?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
What are you lookin' at?
Yes.
What time are visiting hours?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
What's the plan.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Brilliant.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Are you sure?
You want to tell me about it?
You saw a lot in one night.
Actually. I've been in twice.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
You were late.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Jeffrey? Why?
What was that all about?
It's okay.
NO.
You want to dance?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
What are watchin' this junk for?
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
The Duke?  What did you do?
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Look under the body.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
You think they sold me out? No way.
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Would someone please come over here and...
Fuck!
me up the...
He got beat up by a girl.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Destroy all that which is evil...
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
So what do you think?
We do not want your tired and sick.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
She was in here when it went down.
Of course they were. How many?
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
Pee...Per...Man.
So what are you thinkin' here?
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
Twist of lemon!
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Promise me boys.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
We'll keep going, Roc.
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
Yes.
Yes.
Have you no fear of God?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Where are you going?
It had an alarm.
But he didn't say anything.
Loop around real fast.
Dignan, calm down.
Where's the manager?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Well, then cut it in half.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
Hi.
What the fuck is going on here?
They don't?
Obviously. That's a given.
See, now we've got a plan.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Yes. I do.
You're all clear.
Any activity?
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
He did?
Yeah.
You're living on a sailboat?
I think I may have found a way out of here.
You're kidding.
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Nice to meet you.
That was a test?
How does that feel?
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Are you afraid?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
We're renegades from despair.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
What?
You think I'm improving?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
No.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
So who's going to know?
That never would of --
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
What did I say?
I warned you, Dignan.
I think we might of scared her.
Bob.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
His name was Swifty?
It's registered in my mother's name.
My brother's in jail.
How long has he been in there?
I can't do that, Bob.
Come on in. What you been up to?
That's OK.
The elevator broke.
Hold on --
Is he good?
Join the party, fellas.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Who? Applejack?
No. Just pool.
It's locked.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
There was a mistake.
I want to know about Treadstone.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
Sorry to wake you.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
She say what time I should call?
It was staged?
Who else knows about this?
That's not what happened to your parents.
I have to go now.
So why didn't you kill me then?
-- my coat -- but we should --
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
I worry when you get like this.
No... How?
That's crazy.
What if it's not who you think it is?
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
I know it's a dream.
See that tram coming around the corner?
My first job.
No... Jason... please...
What do you want?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Who's going? Us?
This is everything? Is there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Mr. Nevins?
And why is that?
Anything?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
It was in Latin, sir.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Young Robert, we are honored --
What is it?!
Rest, William.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
No. He did not.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
We're gonna be late again.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
How long will I be in here?
Weirder than this?
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
What?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
I get it. You can drop it now.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Because you're... different.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
...yes.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Come on, go on...
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Hey, what'd you do that for?
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Monsieur Rick?
Yes?
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
-- Tonight he forgot.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
No.
We said "no questions."
Please.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Because you're getting on that plane.
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
No.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Our faithful friend is still there.
He suggested I ask you.
Thank you. I try.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
Yes. What is it you want?
No, Captain, please.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
For the time being.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
But everybody's having such a good time.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
He is traveling with a lady.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Oh, thanks.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Get me the Radio Tower!
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
I don't want them here overnight.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Do too much, I'll die.
Take it.
No.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
What's so damn funny?
You can't make it.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
No.  that was the last one.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
How was Russia?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Got to follow the paper path here.
You know, for when you travel.
That's your dog.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
If I'd known you were alive --
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What's that, written on the sail?
So simple to say, so hard to do.
I love you, Chuck.
Anything else?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
What about the sender?
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
How'd it go?
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
For the third time.
To Wilson.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
San Francisco.  And you?
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
I'm *not* a doctor!
I mean your parents.
I've never seen a lobster.
I know.
So. Not bored yet?
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
You don't miss it?
It will be okay.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
Please don't...
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
You mean somebody asked?
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Liberator...
Really! Is it serious?
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
Migrants?
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Rose Rose?
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Then it's malaria?
It look nicer then home!
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
Rose Rose has runned away!
So, what do you do?
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
It's not true.
We were back on.
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
When?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
So that's it...
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Minus one.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Stake you?
Come here. Feel this.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
What -- What do we do?
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
You're just going to have to trust me.
I don't trust anyone.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
It's what I do. It's my job.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
No, I want my cut!
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Stand up.
Eee Oott Auught!
In over your head?
The King, huh? Nice going.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
High five.
Jack Manfred.
You're shaking.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
I despise the job.
Ouch.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
How about fifteen hundred?
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
You want me drunk?
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
I loved it blond.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
I hope it brings you luck.
That girl, she works at the casino --
You're entitled to your opinion.
What?
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Then what?
To coincidence.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
What kind of trouble?
I can't do it, Jani.
And your hand too.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
I'm Lucy.
How long have you worked at the casino?
Rough day?
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
I put them on together.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
You use two alternating, don't you?
How many aces are left?
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
Thanks for the information.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Oh, God...
What was that, I didn't hear...
Fuck that shit.
All right, then...
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Armed.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
Yes, well...
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Which one?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
What's that, sir?
We're running out of time, sir.
How I make my living, what's your point?
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
That's a lotta crap.
Move it.
You mean until you showed up?
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
Damn... Are you alright?
They took my daughter.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
What makes you cry?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
You're a thief?
Girl's gotta make a living.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Girlfriend?
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
So what are you gonna do about it?
I won't be staying.
Bent.
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
How well do you remember the lab?
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
Who is it?
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
How's this about me?
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
A little what?
You know what I'm saying.
A long time.
Unlikely.
Please...
I actually know how this works.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
Max--
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
I'm the victim here.
Really?
Lydia.
I'm a toy to her.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
I want you on call here.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
No problem.
Jeremiah?
Any luck?
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
It's gone.
But we took the keys?
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Look, you can have my wallet...
Gimme your gun, boy!
I did?
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Like a DeLorean.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
What happened to your eye?
You mean soap?
Where are you going?
They suspended me for two days.
Hey.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
You're such a fuck-ass.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
Don't you watch the news?
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
I met a girl.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
I know.
I... I was playing with fire.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Where are we going, Donald?
Then how is time travel possible?
How much are they paying you to be here?
Gerald.
How did you know --
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
How did this happen?
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Oh shit!
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Go on! Get out!
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Yes...
You could be quiet.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
All right, they're makin' a movie.
You don't know where this is gonna...
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
That's right.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
Take a letter.
"My dear President"...
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
"My dear President"...
What's the matter with you?
I don't call him, I whistle.
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
She did.
How'm I doing, boss?
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You swine!
Once more! 
I don't remember.
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
Oh, won't you reconsider...
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
You won't be long?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
I want my man back.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Romance!
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
John... Merrick
Righteousness for his namesake.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Yes.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Ohhh...
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Who are they of?
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
I've heard.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
The workhouse.
No, he's very upset about something.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
It's all right! It isn't happening!
WELCOME?
WHY?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
Five this week; how many the week before?
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
We're just not a very musical nation...
Well, how d'you think I feel?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
I'll tell you what...
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
He wants to kill US!
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Shut up.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Well you started it.
Is THAT Odin?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
What's wrong with making friends?
What's it all about?
You talking piffle, son?
What are YOU doing here?
Look, the sky is blue...
What did he say?
Thank you VERY much indeed.
You'll be sucked down too!
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
Hey, you two! What's going on?
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
You know, my son, our lord said...
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
Well! Come on!
What?
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
Wasn't it, Keitel?
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
So did your father...
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
And you've got BOTH axes?
Yes, Mum.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
Okay, I guess.
In the room?
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
I'm sorry.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
I don't know what that means.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Okay.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Um --
You like that?
I don't know.
Frost?
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
I want to know you.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Right. Something black though.
Is that what you want?
Hi there.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
yeah?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Male or female?
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
A bully? Moi?
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
It's them.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
Naomi.
Okay. I wish you could come.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
That's a good one.
It's stopped.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I know what it is.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Do you like quotes, Howard?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Is that Nietzsche?
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Well, where was Patrick?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
You can if you want.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
What are you doing?
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Hitchhiking?
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
But Countess...
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
The containment, Second Containment...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
Will it work?
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
You weren't there. I saw it.
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
How is he?
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
That's a negative, Starck.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
You said this ship creates a gateway...
Yes...
I don't know...
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
But...
Captain Miller, you copy?
Captain, we got a problem.
Smith, get out of there...
Come again, Skipper?
We can take the filters from the Clark...
What about the life readings you picked up?
What's causing the readings?
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
First time in a grav couch?
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
Hey...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
What the hell is that?
If they are, they're screening their calls.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Oh, he did.
What are you doing here?
About me? How sweet.
Ben, come in.
What did you wish for, honey?
I can't take this.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Five times.
He's made a few changes.
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
And where do we think we're going?
Now what is up with that?
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
You two need a time-out.
What are you doing --
They're ready for you, sir.
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
That's good. That's uh... good.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Not until Ben is back inside!
Ben did this?
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
You said it was urgent.
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Hi, Brad.
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Yes, sir.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Poor guy.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
How often do you go?
I thought he was out of town.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
How's it going.
Don't you like him?
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Well I never did it.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
I paid for it and everything.
I want romance.
Sometime?
But what are you going to do?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
How about the point?
That's a nice shirt.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Do you really have to go?
Where's Mike today?
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Two Cokes.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
Where's the medicine?
How long do I have?
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
The cops?
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
Like big lizards.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
Stop!
I will not die because of him!
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
Who the hell would you call?
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
You seem mighty collected about this.
Why do you take shit from him?
I'm in.
We gotta try.
What is this?
Oh, no.
Really?
Doesn't your foot hurt?
What? Really?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
Huh?
What's it for!?
Clever fuckers.
Fine, Chief.
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
What's wrong?
Oh my God... What is that?
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Excuse me, sir?
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
Thank you --
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
An actress.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
What does Clifford say?
In my eyes, officer.
Get your clothes on.
You learn your lines?
Showdown.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
...Don't you?
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
You wrote it, didn't you?
It's already started, Dad... with me.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Just one minute...
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
You think I'd miss it?
Enh.
How ya doin', Farmer?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
I know what ability you're interested in.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
Think I'll have a glass.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
You know something, Harry?
Where to?
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Your big speech?
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
Why are these all opened?
At one. Promise?
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
Don't I know you?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Stay calm, please.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
Yes.
Friends? Do they live around here?
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Why... her?
Nothing. Still nothing.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
This feels... incestuous.
You make me weak.
Victor. I love you,
I've no choice
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Are you having me on?
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Can you think of a better reason?
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
Thank you, Henry.
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
We should go now.
You draw very well.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
I'll go check on Brenda.
Jack?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
You know what I said, though.
Claudette...
Somebody's there, Barry.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Thanks.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
Chance to get even?
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
Ow!
I love you.
It's beautiful...
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
Another coincidence.
Have you ever been there before?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
I said new, this is an '90.
Jacob.
Where is the little lady?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
No, I didn't.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
Creepy guy.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Not even for lunch?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
He says you were scratching.
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
What the fuck was that about?
Yeah?
Gotcha!
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
I'm lookin' scared?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
Where are you?
That's what I hear.
The woman I saw you with...
Don't say my name.
Wow...
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
I'm not sure what --
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Yes?
Did you hear?
Hardly the case, Senator.
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Uh, question, ma'am.
Yes, dear.
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
O'Neil?
Time.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
I saw an article...
So why are you telling me this?
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
And how do you know that?
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
O'Neil?
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
Say again, sir?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
You knew about us?
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
The first female President?
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
I take it this file is still open.
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Think we can fit up in there?
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
Most people don't.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
I can't.
Well, I think you're cute.
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
They didn't make it.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Sure.
Hello?
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
Don't speak, Quellek.
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
He's a miserable twit!
You could order something in.
Oh my god, It's real.
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Okay, we got it.
What does the Omega 13 do?
Okay, now. But-
Shit! Go!
What?  Up?
The enemy is matching velocity.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
...Okay
They're still behind us...
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
More to the left... Stay parallel...
Not a clue. You?
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
never doubted you for a second.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Commander...
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Find them.
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Over three hundred miles.
Arnold!
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Wil...
No.  I guess.
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
Well, what have you thought?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
What are we going to do?
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
To hell with Arnold...
Oh, come now...
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
We already have black soldiers in our army...
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Surely you knew this was coming.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
To win this war I need an army.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Not today.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
What is this?
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
You get the money?
Not too bad.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
I need the money.
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
The airport.
Depends. Who's this?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Yeah? Which terminal?
You have a card in here?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
You make movies, huh?
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
I'm thinking of a movie.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
How? By taking my money?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
The door from the patio, in back.
You broke in?
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons -
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
I think it's not horrible.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
I want to know.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Harry -
How did you get in the house?
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Sixty pounds.
That's what it says.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Mother fucker!
I thought you said it was just a blade.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Hard to say.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
Three, four days.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
Can't you use something else?
What?!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Don't fall asleep.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
Coffee.
Stay away. Or else.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
Are you sure?
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
Greer?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
The what?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
That much I think we've already established.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
You got that right.
Murphy, goddamit.
You're up late.
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Ho-ly shit.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Who?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
That guy rules!
Forget it.
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
I just stopped in to say hi.
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Hi Enid.
Why?
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
What? How long have you been standing there?
JOSH!
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
Where?
Anthony's II!
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Go ahead...
No, really...
God, you're really obsessed...
Look, we have to get these...
Don't you want nice stuff?
Hello?
What happened to Seymour?
Why? What did he say?
When was this?
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
What time?
Do you want anything?
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
How much is this?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Fine, and how are you?
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
Well why do I care about that?
Indian records?
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Good luck...
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
PLEASE? We have to!
Jesus...
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
For nineteen years...
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
That's the spirit!
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Really?
Boo!
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
Just someone so young...
What's the matter?
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
What about Joe?
What do you want?
Yeah, well... me neither...
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Why? What did she tell you?
That slut!
Did she say that?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What are you talking about?
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
John, it will not be easy.
Second death? Where?-
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
Have you got it?
Has it ever done that before?
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Why?
Oh yes, I think so. 
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Janosz?
What do you want with my baby?
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
Everybody has a choice.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
What are you working on, Egon?
Occasionally
Certainly.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
His name is Oscar.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
That's where the buggy stopped.
So this is what you do, huh?
Good-bye, Peter.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
That's quite a story.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
-- the sorrow --
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
I'm Egon --
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Does it have any favorites?
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Aren't you glad we waited?
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
You really don't act like a scientist.
That's it.  Get out.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
I'm not at liberty to say.
A square?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Oh!  You're here.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Don't cross the beams.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
It's working!
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
What is it?
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Agile bastard, isn't he?
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
Don't you think you should at least wave?
For the gods, spit it out!
Yes?  Go on!
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Then you'd be out of a job.
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
Give away food?
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
The Senate too?
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
Why you?
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
So I understand.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
Let him trust Quintus.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Then get a large cash advance.
Do you know what you're going to do?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
Yes.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
What is it?
Where are you meeting this person?
I've never been to it.
No.
But you're not enrolled.
I said I think it is.
All right then! Yes!
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
But Elaine --
You won't?
I don't know.
When?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
We just can.
Why wouldn't it?
The day after tomorrow?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
I am going to call the police now.
Hello.
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Can I help you, sir!
Sir?
You don't?
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
But it's light in there now.
Drink?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
What do you think of me?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What's wrong?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
So?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
I think I'll go to bed.
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
What are you so scared of?
Let me out!
Benjamin?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Thank you.
Either one will be fine.
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Well what do you want to talk about?
Anything. Anything at all.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
There isn't any.
I walk out.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
See if you can guess.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
No.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Good.
Yes.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Mrs. Robinson --
Then you'd better start believing me.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
When I go off?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
I guess -- about my future.
To be what?
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
I've got to go.
Thank you very much, sir.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Oh yes.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
I am not threatening you.
You miss the point.
Yes?
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
Is anything wrong?
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Well?
And what are you going to do?
How?
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
Have you seen it?
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Aren't you?
You're very funny --
Of course.
Chasing around.
Yes -- I'd love to.
I feel sorry for him.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Why do you look at me like that?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
You are beautiful!
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
No?
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
I'll not denounce you.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
If we could scare up some men to play.
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang... 
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Please -- please!
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
Yes, of course, -- money!
You don't understand that do you?
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Do you like me better?
You pay me.
What is this?
Moreover...
Not too quickly.
Definitely off.
I understand perfectly.
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
What?
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
I wish to be alone.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
I don't know you.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Me?
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
No. No word.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
Next week.
What you need is some relaxation.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
What do you want with her?
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Right in front of the room.
Want a look?
Can't move.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Here you are! Two rich people!
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Just myself.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
They knocked out my tooth!
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
Not as tough as you, huh?
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
Going somewhere?
No.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
What?
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
I know you do, so that's why --
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
Where's the five?
Mama!
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
No.
What?
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
And when he got serious?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
Open your door.
You -- I don't know.
I saw her.
She didn't see you, in other words.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
I'm happy the way I am.
I realize this is a shock.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Yes, I know, I know.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Mr. Simms.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Care to join me?
Carter.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
It's Amy Kramer.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Nothing.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where are you going?
Get on the bus.
You stole it?
You really think Eddie killed her?
I'm okay.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Who?!
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
It was you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Jamie's baby ...
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
How all the magazines show tits today.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Home.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
I'm liable to find anything!
How do you know that?
I didn't know we had any women left.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
In what way, pray tell?
Maybe it's time you got out.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
What an awful sound!
I've considered that.
Out!
Hello.
Hello.
Dr. Woodly.
What's good about that?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
A hundred dollars!
The smallest thing I've got.
Mom?
No.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
No.
I'm talking to you gently now.
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
You don't even know me.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
Now that's what I call fun.
A trip, you mean?
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
I have a brain.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
No.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
It couldn't!
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Yes.
And what is his most cherished possession?
I don't think so.
No you're not!
Why not?
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Things.
Almost a Christmas scene.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
I plan to live one hundred years!
Ah!  The lady is armed.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
We'll miss you so.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
None.
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
I thought she was a widow.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
You're a son of a bitch.
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
I'm utterly satisfied.
What are you going to do?
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
You don't know?
It was a bitch.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Alice is dead?
For what?
So long, you guys.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
Don't worry about it.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
No.
Oh, Paul--
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
No.
Yeah.
Then get him.
My father!
He isn't?
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
What was it?
Possibly.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
Kid--kid--
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
Yes, we do.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
No.
No, just not the type.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
That's cool.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Is this all the display space we can get?
Sam?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Three hundred?
Huh?
A friend.
Say what?
'Sucking off.'
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
But it's all you do.
Not very.
I can stop if you want.
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
Why do you say that?
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
That's right.
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
What have you found out?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
They are?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Who made it?
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
What is it, Jake?
Is Marsha there?
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Well...
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
Where's Ratan?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
But I...
That's all right.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Hold it, mister.
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
Huh?
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
You working in San Diego now?
No.
You are at the University, Candy?
Okay, lady. Out.
Is this your shovel?
Because if you are...
And what do you do, my dear?
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
What do you see?
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Thank you, but I really have to go.
No.
How about some ginger pie?
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
It goes on and on.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
You are the wisest person I know.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
- end where I began.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Oh, is this your father?
Why?
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
I don't know.
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Yes.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Yes.
How about to slit his throat?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
We've always been here.
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
I knew you'd come back.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Wait!
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
He talked about Demons, huh?
Nah -- he's taken care of.
hound of resurrection --
See? I don't like that --
It's almost over!!
I thought you liked being on TV.
Who wards off demons.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
Each of us gets a belt.
-- should go back. Now!
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Goodnight, then.
A brute.
Hello, I'm --
What's the problem?
Hi.
What's happening?
Alright, let's give it another try.
Got her mother's looks.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Let me alone, will you?
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
You're Julia, right?
Wedded bliss?
I'm very happy.
Don't look at me.
No. God no.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
This is what began it.
Who did?
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
So you were cheated.
You can't love him.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Don't you care?
Well we can't just stay here --
Where's Daddy?
It smells damp.
You're still blaming me.
All right.
How are you doing through there?
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
I'm here.
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Please...
What are you talking about?
What?
What are you drinking?
Please.
Well, isn't it?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
You'd like the house.
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
O.K.
Are you O.K.?
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I want to see.
Where are you going?
All right.  No. That's nice.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
She's so damn... English.
Are you alright ?
Not the point.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
What?
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
What the fuck is that?
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Fuck off, Barry.
What the fuck is that?
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Why not?
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
On Clark Street!
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Uh.  That's me.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Your desert island top-five.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Is there a difference?
What do you mean, four more?
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Huh?
No, that's okay.  Really.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
Just the obvious stuff.
What?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Is what better?  Better than what?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
Hi.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
We'll talk some other time.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Who the fuck's Pig?
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
You're soaking.
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Let's go home.  Okay?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
More confident, maybe.
You're being stupid.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
You called this morning?
That way.  You?
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
I warned you.
It's my birthday.
It's not mine.
Byzantine?
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Where?
Not your concern.
He sees me as a threat.
No one knows you're here?
When you finish, what then?
You want me to front for you.
You're using your son's name.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
At least.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
Yes.
What is it like?  Being you?
What's wrong?
The inheritance.
I'm just curious.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
Thanks.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What do you want from me?
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
What are you getting at, Moran?
You're an asshole, Moran.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
Good way to lose your job.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
Stop.
Your name is Conor?
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
I was nearly killed.
I was driven out.
Why are you here?
You are the same?
It is less.
I'm twenty-two.
Why does he want to kill me?
Aye.
Me arm hurts.
I am not ready for this.
Some think not.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Stay out of it.
You see Major?  You are not so different...
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
How are you?
I haven't drunk this much since-
Long time.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
It doesn't.
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
My condolences.
Where were you Tuesday night?
We were very close.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
No. Roy. Roy V.
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Hildy!
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
Out of the mouths of babes.
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
How long is what?
Sure you can. Come on.
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Dead?
Keep away --
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
Bermuda.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
What's his line?
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
You said it.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Huh!
Where's Bruce?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Will you come here?
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Don't open that!
No!
Flip a coin.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
What!
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
Walter!
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
You said it!
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Who locked the door?
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
What a chase!
Gus, this --
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
After all I've done for you --
Pete, I want to talk to you!
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
Who is it?
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
You fight it cut.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Huh?
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
No, I don't think so.
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Is it hard?
Get out of here!
Can I try?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Sod.
You couldn't.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Well, for the baby, really.
A bit too quick.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
So you're going to be a grandfather.
And absent bridegrooms!
You joined up.
And what's that?
What are you going to be then?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
I can't do it. What's the point?
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
Yikes.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Cone.
I agree.
What about R.J.?
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
What's this?
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
Perfect.
It's a hitchhiker.
She looks like she stinks.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Almost there.
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
Quiet.
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
So.
Why?
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Yeah, no mercy here.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
Sorry.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Not in front of the boy.
My little French.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Like what?
Anyway. Come already to the point.
I've moved on.
I want our boy back.
Oui.
That's what I'm counting on.
Ouch. Yeah?
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Yeah. My brother told me.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
How's it going?
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
I'm not sure.
My God! The fork! The fork!
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
You do?
You really enjoy my company?
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Absolutely.
A deer?
I think he's feral.
It's perfect!
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Who is it?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
You have to shave? Like an ape?
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
That's great.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
I think he's ready.
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
So he's doing okay?
Shit.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Oook. Oook.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Ugnh.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
Check!
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
Do we need words?
How?
Are you ready for another?
That's the way it's done.
Okay?
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
Hey, Findley's here.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
They're fine.
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
I wanna walk.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Maybe. You want to play?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Why?
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
How do you feel?
No, it isn't, Charlie.
Eddie...
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Go to hell.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Yeah, that's what I think.
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
What's the limit?
Okay, friend. You're on.
What time does the bus leave?
What bus?
Then why go to the bus station?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
What time is it?
Why?
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
Haven't you opened it?
What's this supposed to mean?
He's a gambler.
For how long?
No, I want to walk.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
He went off someplace.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
You name it.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
What about... now?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Do you remember where it is?
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
What do you mean?
What's inside?
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Virginia...?
Bathroom?
What's that, Dad?
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
I left it at work.
What did he talk to you about?
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
Why?
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
Where, Jimmy?
Who are you calling?
Damn.
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
I have school.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
I take it you've heard.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
What's the bad news?
Can you believe this?
What're you talking about?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
This I can see.
With their shields down it might be possible.
You can't go. Call them back.
What?
Yeah, but what an entrance!
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
We're already over Mach 2!
Stop it.
It's all fuzzy.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
All your life.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
What?
Tapestries?
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
I usually don't either.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Bingo.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
You said go between them!
Mine, too.
Uh-huh.
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
You came back for the book? Why?
Then wait -- count to twenty.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Dad, are we hit?!
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
That was seven hundred years ago.
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
Who are you?
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
Lao She.
What's that?
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
You will go to palace there.
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
You don't look very good.
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
What?!
Can you move your arm?
Just one arm!
Oh really?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Primitive sexual practices?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
You've got to go to sleep now.
You're not gonna believe this...
Your name is Al...
Where are we?
Right.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Yeah...Who?
Me? What'd I do?
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
I wouldn't say that.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
Yeah...Who is?
Find You?
I'm at the airport.
I'll get in trouble.
Now what?
Do you notice anything.
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Eat it?
Beautiful!
What was?
Touch her.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
What did that cost?
You shut down your sensors.
You been had. We have.
Sapporo..
Never mind, just say it.
Dieter!
Be quiet.
About what?
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
You're a lucky man.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
Awwww...
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
Sorry...
What kind of a deal?
Who's our little man?
He work for us?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
It's just money.
That name's familiar.
And how do you service foreigners.
What brings you here?
You may not remember things.
Right.
Fine. You look fine.
Joe.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
What do you do about what?
Is someone else here?
Let you leave without it.
Me still. They left you alone?
As if your mind's not all there.
You're talking to me.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Wanted to get to know you.
What do you mean?
You work for Ryuji?
You know where he went?
He must be a good friend.
Hong Kong.
Why'd you ask him.
What happened?
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
What about the others.
Why?
It'l be alright.
Hi, honey.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
How long?
We gotta hook up.
When's your deadline?
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
Alright, alright.
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
What are you cooking?
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
You're exaggerating!
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
That computer has everything...
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
How grave?
Yeah?
Is there any more rice...?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Soy sauce...
I didn't want to leave it there...
I don't understand.
Thomas Sandefur...
What's the difference...
No classes this morning?
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Area code 212-555-0199.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
No shit.
Oh, man.
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
I disappeared on you?
Yeah, that's right.
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Yeah... Thank you.
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Far as you go where?
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
What do...
Seven dwarfs?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
The new place? New.
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
Lowell, I can't afford --
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
Just give me an example...
Well, what do you really think, though?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
There is -- there is no family.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
Object to the form!
Is that a threat?
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
I'd just like to have a word with her.
You're in a rush.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Triple!
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
Why in God's name would I want...?
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
What do you mean, was.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
How nice.
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Screw you, asswipe!
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She held that against you?
And here I thought my mother was...
Your mother was.
No, we're not!
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Good.  Are those foods?
Miles? You're scaring me.
May I come in?
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Income tax evasion?
Murder!
We are. And it's winding down.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
Miles Massey.
Do you know him?
Every week --
So where are you now?
You're not...
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Ah.
Wrigley?
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
Extinguish?
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Yes, sir?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
I might.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
South America.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Oh, no.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
What happened to your money?
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
No.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Oh, yeah?
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
I don't want it reported!
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Do you mind putting out the light?
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
I can't go out like this.
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
You always want to run everything.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
It takes money to buy food.
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
Thought you were hungry!
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
What for?
Better go back to your bed.
I love you.
Congratulations.
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Where's the bus to New York?
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Isn't he here?
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
SorryI didn't mean to
Yeah? Where?
Mr. Gordon
Get out of here!
Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Well, I got it, Joe.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
What?
Collect?
Mebbe.
Who?
Huh?
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
What's on your mind?
Huh?
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Orange, New Jersey.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
What was so appealing about Houston?
And then Sunday?
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Why?  What's wrong?
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
And Shaw?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
Four to six.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
They killed him, honey.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Can we find her?
Between six and seven seconds.
No.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Yes.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
More than ten years.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
She's the best damn witness we have!
Sure sounds like he's winning.
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Germany.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
And what would I have to do?
Yes?
Virginia.
Do you walk home?
What are they?
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
You were there for me.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
She almost sounds scared.
What's she willing to give us?
We are. Don't worry about it.
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
This is your money?
Take your time.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Why does it need to be dark?
You gain weight?
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
He came by.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
You're gonna offer to set him up?
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Why?
What're you, a bag lady?
You talk them into it?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
When did you decide?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Did you do it that night?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
How'd you find out?
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
I never lied to you.
I thought you were tired of your business?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
Oh, so now you know him?
Who's the other one?
She didn't say.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Uh-huh.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Yeah, do you like it?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
I knew it.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
Yeah.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
The Cockatoo Inn.
You told em? You told em it's me?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Didja tell 'em anything else?
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
I'll give ya ten.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
What for?
Were you a disco guy?
No.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Wanna fuck?
Uh-huh?
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
Are you serious?
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
So we on the same page then?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
You shot Melanie?
You couldn't just hit her?
Where did you shoot her?
Came outta where?
Then what?
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
How can I help you?
That's Winston. He works here.
It's in my bag.
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
You don't say.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
I'm alone.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
This place stinks.
She was afraid.
You expect me to just walk in there?
It's the next street.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
Take me home.
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Della?
Hello, Sam.
Are you all right?
How do you know?
Daddy!
What do you want from me?
That's right. We did.
Well, try, huh.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
I'm hanging up.
Hey, wait!
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
... I've seen them, too.
I saw Sarah the other day.
Who?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
Hell, you think I am?
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
What's wrong?
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
They weren't human!
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
That's your decision.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
Bullshit!
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
I'm tired.
You can have anything you want.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Goddamn you!
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
I no from around here.
Please come quietly.
He'll never make it.
Lennox Hospital.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
I need to see you, Jake.
Nope.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Who is?
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Bring it in.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Yes it does.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
Nice touch.
You see that?
I'll need system four converters.
Hey! I'm not ready.
Goodbye, my love.
Hurry!
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Hey.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
Jesus!
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
Almost done.
Ow!
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
The power's back up!
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
Jason? He's on this ship?!
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Just a favor for your old man.
Did you bring a check?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
Who's driving the boat?
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
Shut up! Just pump her out!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
Don't forget these.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Now tell me something I don't know.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
Rogue?
He ate a car?
Chum?
What is all this stuff?
Why don't we just tow it in?
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
And nobody else saw her in the water?
You from around here?
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
Leg of lamb this time?
Twenty years.
You love sharks?
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
20 feet, if it's an inch...
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
What's up?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Wait, let me take that.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
I don't really know anything about it.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
What do you play?
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
Why aren't you at work?
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
Hey, I like this.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Cold feet.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
Oh, okay. Like this.
I'm leaving Vanessa.
What?
No?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Then what's going on?
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
You're pregnant?
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Yeah, like people in love.
What?!
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Aw, please Junebug?
No way! She's pretty.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
What did you do?
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
What would be a good time for you?
...Pardon?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
What's this?
It's a portfolio of my work.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
How many times you gonna tell me that?
...thank you.
What's your name, boy?
Where you from Walter?
Henry Lucas.
Dahlia, no.
Yeah?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
If you say so.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
What happened to Adele?
Thanks. What are you doing?
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
What are you going to do?
...never?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Early, just think...
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
You were plenty hot.
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
What is it?
...That'd be my guess.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
She can fuck?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Did what take?
How?
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
You think he's got any herb?
78th.
It is right.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Yep.
Who?
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
Why I do what?
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Casper! Was up kid?
Where you goin' tonight?
Yeah.
What?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
No.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
You still mad at him?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
Yeah.
Hi mom.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
By yourself?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
You are!  I don't like you.
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
You alright?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Just like who?
Just for that no hint today.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
Have you any idea what the message is?
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Is your dad here?
I know he really likes you.
How long has she been dead?
Well?
I'm busy right now.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
Did you see his face?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Through a rental agency.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
Did you send the car?
It's a good play, but risky.
You have something you want to say?
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Uh huh.
Yes.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
We need your help.
Of course.
Why?
She died in a car accident.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
You've got to face the things you feel.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
I know it.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
I won't leave you here.
Turold's son was to marry her.
There is nothing.
They know when they're going to die?
But you suspect.
The spiral begins in the west.
Use your sword.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
I can. Because I choose it.
You have done it?
I ache with it.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
You will follow me.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
These we'll pay for.
Hand over your dinner.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
What is that awful looking place?
No.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I have a cinnamon bar.
I'm hungry.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
Food for crows.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
You know the voice.
Can you see?
The Widow of the Web?
She has the power to kill.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
Where is he? My son.
No?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
The fat man down there, on the bench.
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
...I'm going to kiss you.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
Where are you going?
A little...
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Yes.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Yes... Twice.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
Mine.
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
Pardon?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
Yes.
I thought we both wanted the same things.
You can change.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
What's his story?
Not our problem.
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
What, come on?
Don't do this.
Good morning.
What do you want?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
Sera...
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
What do you mean?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Will you lighten up, please?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
Yes? What?
But it's a top three school --
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Huh?
Did you get it?
I do. I'm not allowing it.
Was she carrying a weapon?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
No.
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
It's not my alibi to tell --
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Josh proposed!
She's completely untrustworthy.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
How could this happen?
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
I got bangs!
What're you doing here?!
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
And I fully support that.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
No, silly. I go here.
Good. Good.
I didn't mean --
Thanks for the backup.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Why do you say that?
Why?!
There he is!
Fool's magic.
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
You go?  Not watch fun?
We watch... good fun...
You're magnificent.
And you... are you not also afraid?
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Why have you brought me here?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Or looked so beautiful...
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
You come stealee tleasoo?
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
East of Mercia?
Flozen foleva not good.
Enough!
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Shhhh!
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
What know you of fields of war?
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Nice piece of work.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
God's blessing.
Wait!
We'll find it.
Wait, Jack.
Easily spoken...
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
I don't... understand.
Did you bring me here to sup?
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Don't get too far!
I've not heard a note out of you.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
These for me?
A gentleman would offer water.
What's the matter?
I'm not its master.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
They rival the angels of paradise.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
What happened?
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
Then, perchance you'll me.
No!  I won't let it happen...
Sunlight?
That's why he goes masked during the day...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
What's the matter?
Biting you?
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Ask away, sweet man.
As fair as me?
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
In every way.
I'm promised to another!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
What do we do now?
Hello, Jack.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
To Castle Couer de Noir?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
Marco!
Are you going to see Sam again?
I wanna be with you today.
And why was the alarm on?
No.
Can you keep Sam straight?
You have to ask like that?
What did you think it would be?
Why?
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
Why are you so stupid?
Mr. Stevens?
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
how much weight have you lost?
He buys and sells the world.
Forty.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
For everything.
Uh huh.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
George, this is the third time.
Why would you be there?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
Where is it?
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
How do you become something you're not?
Nothing.
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
Getting high, I guess.
Are you talking?
Sun glasses?
To hide a black eye.
I would have killed him.
You look better than ever.
I still don't know what that means.
Good for you.
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
How many bedrooms will your house have?
You should lock your doors.
What are you doing?
He never answers.
Why would they tow your truck?
Why call me?
It makes me sad.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
Which?
What have you been before today?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
Do you need help?
I smiled at him.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I could die.
I better get the kids home.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
You got a dog?
Do you know anything about building a house?
Yeah.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Adam, that's not true!
Nigger.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Is Spanky here?
Then what's the problem?
Yeah...
Want me to come back some other time?
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Claude Banks.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
Here I am.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
Claude.
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
It's a pardon from the governor.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Go where, Ray?
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
I can't eat this.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
I know you're not talking to me...
How you doin'?
You ever done time before?
You got your own nightclub?
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
All in, boss!
1932? That's like, that's like...
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Appreciate it.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
What are you in for, Willie?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
I'm interested. Keep talking.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
And he's dead serious.
That's what I thought!
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
And give you a good buzz.
Urr... uggg... errr...
I'll call her later.
My mom wasn't a goat?
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
Where is he? He's late.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Now everybody sit down.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
You're a good devil, Dad.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
Look who's back from the dead.
You sure you're down with this?
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
You followed him?
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Please. You got to.
If you want to.
"Octopus people?"
I think I'm floating.
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
Nicky!
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
All right -- what are you?
From? From? From?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
What other food?
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
Just wondered... what happens?
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Later.
Six. I go red next year.
You could have called me yourself.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
You know something.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
Are you here to help me?
Of course --
Uh-uh.
I have.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
What's that?
I hate outside! I hate it!
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
We can't. We're going back.
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
We'll have to bury him.
What makes you think so?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
Not yet.
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
Yes...
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
You okay, man?
I'm, okay... You okay?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
You recognize that guy?
You know what I think?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
I don't know.
You like it?
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
What deal?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
In pornos?
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
Are you my man?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Yeah.
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
Yeah? what did they want?
Never saw him before in my life.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
There's no other bedroom?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
What is it?
Where's Alice?
What night?
Called? When?
Yeah?
What's that? Another tape?
We've got to call the police.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
They're gonna cook him.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
What's goin' on?
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
You still care about me?
Sheila... Stop...
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Uh-huh.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Yes, it just shows  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Okay, brother.
Don't call me brother.
Why, of course. Yes.
It certainly is.
Look here
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Well, that's that, I guess.
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
You mean you don't want to go?
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including  the excess of virtue itself.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
108 and still active?
You're startled?
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Then it's done.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Are you the High Lama?
Sondra Bizet.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
Did I say "if"?
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
Oh, George . . .
Why not?
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
A man whose life was empty!
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
I'm thirty.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Hesitated, sir.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Cowan--
Cowan--
And if I say yes?
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Actually, sir--
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Sir, you can't just--
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
I taught kindergarten.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
He's here to help!?
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
We need to talk to you about the alien.
How's Dee?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
They went right to the President.
Did it leave?
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
No.  Follow him.
Please --
Oh, God...
Please, I want to go back...
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
It's all I could safely move.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
What?
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
You're certain?
Yes.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
If it's a question of authority.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
So?
Stop --
Rufus, play it back...
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
I wanted to.
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
But you have to.  They said you would.
The precogs were wrong.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
Who made you do this?
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
What's so funny?
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Oh, God, what did you do?
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
Tell him not now.
Congratulations, sir.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
I wanna kill my boss.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
He looks familiar.
Who?
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
Since right after we lost our son.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
To what?  Trap him?
They've never been separated before.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
What, sir?
Where's the place to go tonight?
Holy shit.
Is he cute?
What's wrong, baby?
No.
Honey?
Oh, please.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
I'll support you.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
I said no touching.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
You driving her?
How bad is it?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Ruiz tied in out there?
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
Where we going?
Where's Ricky?
That it?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Nah.
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Ruiz isn't here.
What about boxing?
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
He didn't say we need guns.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
How'd you unlock my phone?
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
I'll get the girl.
Yeah, I guess.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Oh really. Why's that?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
I don't know.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
You got that right.
What are you doing.
C'mon, man...
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
All the more reason.
You're out of money?
What do you have left?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
It's gonna be fine.
Dude, we were practically made...
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
No. I'll wait here.
Hey, boys.
Bobby and Ricky.
C'mon...
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Excuse me.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Nah, man...
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
She poured it for --
No...
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Edinburgh.
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
What?
Daddy, where's my money?
What you talking?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
Shit, what else she gonna say?
I'm wearing, Archie.
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
You ain't lying.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Elijah who?
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I don't know how.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
No, Brother Minister.
What?
I see your point.
Why do you ask?
Are you?
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
Yes. Did you eat?
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
I'm not made of glass.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I assumed...
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
If you want to tell me.
Did you see the papers today?
I better not come in.
How long has this been going on?
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You're my father.
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
What do you want?
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
[Reina Rosas.]
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Drive.]
[Who ordered it?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[Don't lie to me!]
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Not at all?
No.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Could I stop you?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Where are you?
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
For a year?
[No. Why?]
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
What?
What makes you say that?
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Waddaya gonna do now?
What for?
All right, I'll see you!
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
This is the kitchen.
Marty...
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
So I'll call you tomorrow.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Are you kidding?
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
That's the one.
What time is it?
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
...and they sit down right next to me...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
That's all right, that's all right...
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
You boys'll have to go to work early.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
What the hell's going on here?
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
When will he be able to write?
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
People will talk.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Wait a second...
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
Gimme three.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
Black capsule.
I don't feel anything.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
You're an attractive man.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Even if I weren't.
You're asking for somebody else?
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Yes, Reverend?
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
The one and only.
There's only one worth noticing.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
What's going on? Who started this?
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Never mind.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Against anything. Just protest.
Oh, yuh did, huh?
No.
Who?
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
What do you do when you work?
Baseball?
Go out and find her!
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh
What?
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Four bits.
Join the John Doe Club.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
How about family? Got any family?
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Uh-huh.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
Not that we know of.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
You want me to go up with you?
What happened? Is there a problem?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Who are you again?
...a car.
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
Is that all?
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
What's the point of this?
National Marksman Competition.
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
Explain how that works.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
Tell me what you need.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
Yes.
How much you wanna bet?
He's cutting down the visibility.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
What do you want from me?
If you did, you never showed it.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
It's okay. We broke up.
When?
How's Paco doing?
Yeah?
Korda escaped.
A deeper level?
You crazy? With all those people around?
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
Roper.
What?
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
And a car.
What have you promised them?
The guests are here.
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
Not my problem.
It's not real.
New York.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
He had access to the keys --
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
Why would I do that?
Then where is she?
No.
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
I'm sorry.
Don't know what you're talking about.
There?
Just like that?
Activated.
Resurrection.
Access granted.  Male or female?
We've got him locked!
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
What's a Triac?
You okay?
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
It's... an eagle?
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
"Basically".
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
What is THAT!
NINJA APE ZORD!
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
So Chicago's been good to ya.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
Are you frightened?
I had everything. Once.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
No. Not everything.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
The deal's too good, Frankie
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
You got something to hide?
London?
If I look weak now, it's over.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
Would it be painful for you?
Charlie?
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
You bastards, I said twenty!
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
He's trying to make it.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
And the Jews?
We learn from life.
You disrespect our tradition.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
That a Jew compliment?
Who did this?
Switch hands.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Why?
Tell me what?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Sure. Why?
You're acting kind of...odd.
Can't you give it to me later?
I might wake up.
I don't think so.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Don't ask where I got it.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
<u>What</u> union?
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
You want to come inside?
How are you doing sweetheart?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
And where is she?
Yeah.
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Thanks very much, sonny--
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
Looks like it, but--
It couldn't be.
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
Would you settle for a husband?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Waiter!
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
I apologize.
Yeah.
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
All right, why?
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
The--head?
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Than what?
Jeff for Senator.
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Just a minute, I better make sure.
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Will the Senator yield?
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Yes, I was--
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Mr. President--
I have no defense against forged papers and--
Will the Senator--
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
I don't see where we are *with* it.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
It *is* not!
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Great.
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Wait--
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
You were about to recognize me, sir--
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Do I actually *see* this--?
Father--oh.
Mr. President...
That's going to be fun.
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
Since he was born.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
He's still pixilated.
Any children?
No, no children.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
I haven't.
Yes!
Oh, thank you!
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
There's Times Square.
He did? I play the tuba
What did he play?
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Well, here we are again.
What's the matter, hon?
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Yes.
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
I'm going to tell him the truth.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Yes, sir.
You try it.
Sit over there, will you?
Thank heaven.
Your Honor, I object.
Mr. Cedar!
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Hang up.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
You can't?
All set.
Yeah?
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
No?
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Huh?
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
That's funny. Why is that?
Entertainment?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Let him alone.
Mrs. Semple?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
Proceed.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Who are they?
Where is your farm?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
What's that?
But she's on the telephone
Why are they ganging up against me?
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Why's that?
But you do therapy?
...And I from Phyllis.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
No?
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Tastes good.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
And the Brocketts?
He told you.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
Hello, Lionel.
What's wrong with her?
We're going for a walk.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Could I see Sofie, please?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
Even if you don't think it's real?
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
I'm not making any promises.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
And this is legitimate therapy?
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
Yeah?
Of course.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
I am irate!
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
It's my bit for the community.
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
Do you think that's what he wants?
No again?
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
I've got three big ones.
Jerking off?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
I can tell you anything else.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
And a birth certificate is enough?
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
What does he want the book for?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Two hundred pounds.
Every damn day.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
How?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Is he supposed to look like that?
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
Jonathan?
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
I'm your sister.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Hey,... don't I know you?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
We gotta get her back.
And what's that?
We could really use some coffee --
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Are you with me... or against me?
Really?
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Who?
Date?
What's your real name?
What?
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
But there's still only six of us.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
But she still might call!
I'll drive.
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Hi.
She likes you.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Be a Mohican.
And a social life.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
That was too close.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Bastia -- and you?
I haven't been there for three years.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
Why didn't you wake me then?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
And he sent you to me?
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
No... nothing at all.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
When is she supposed to return?
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
May I offer you a drink?
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
Promises mean nothing.
All right -- I promise.
Yes -- what is it?
Five minutes.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
Why not?
That's all I can say.
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
What?
God help me -- yes.
How do you know?
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
No.  Thought he was with you.
Stretch it out.
Who are you?
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
It's about to work, just come on.
Nobody!
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
What's the B-G's?
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
Karla.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
You want us to give you a ride?
Can I help you?
Here I come!
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
What it smell like?
You coming in?
What kind of activity?
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
What is it?
I do.
Where did Craig move to?
William.
Huh?
Hey, how you get out of here.
Nothing.  What you want?
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Elroy.
What you doing to my nephew?
Mr. Nasty time?
You sent my assistant on an errand.
'S okay. What do you think?
Where did you get these? Who are you?
The gun...
Again.
Is that something precious?
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
Are you sure?
No way.
Keep it.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Please...
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
What?
That's right.
What are you supposed to do?
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
What?
Everybody does?
That's pretty good.
Close your eyes.
Get moving.
And what happens if I don't call you?
What do you figure he done with it?
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
I been mindin' Pearl.
O, she's all right.
Uncle Birdie!
I'll light the lamp.
AAA-MENN!
Yes! Yes!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
You go set down by the River.
My, that fudge smells yummy!
Hing, hang, hung.
To see Dad?
Where are we goin', John?
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
Story, honey? Why, what story?
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
I mind you said there was two.
I'll see to Pearl.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
I'll tell you a secret.
Now it's your turn.
What's your name?
O no! Your turn!
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
Get up, Willa.
Do you want more children, Willa?
She took them kids with her?
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
Them kids!
None of your business, Madam.
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
It's just a stupid cat.
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
You believe in anything?
Uh-oh...
Hello?
You do?
Bring him out of what?
You used me, daddy!
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
Where you think you're going?
I won't.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
Just sleep now, Mom.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
You feel better now, right?
Well, here are fifty francs.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
A dress you wear in the evening.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
And there?
You want this?
You wouldn't like Razinin.
That's her.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Capitalistic methods...
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
What a lovely room you have here.
You didn't get legal advice?
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Leon, my little boy.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
What proposition?
A day.
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
What's that?
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
If there is anything we can do for you...
What can I do about it?
What business?
You, please.
Me?
At what intervals does he whistle?
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
And what is your profession?
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
Ni-notchka.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
As a representative of Moscow...
You know I want to...
Why?
Yes.
You remember this room?
I promise... I swear.
I don't think so.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
I must talk to my brothers!
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
No speech?
Our salute will be a kiss.
But I can throw it out of the window.
It is their wish.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Now, Swana...
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
You haven't seen her yet?
All right, I'll listen.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
What?
We have nothing to discuss.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
We'll see about that ...
Son of a bitch.
Executive clemency ...
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
Pay him.
No, sir.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
That's what they're doing.
He's completely lost touch with reality.
Sir, the deadline is today.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
Lincoln used it.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
Their fourth!
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
Well, why not?
Silence!
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
Sir?
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
We really must go, Mr. President.
What?
How?
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
My friends call me "Mister President."
You'll win the nomination.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Mein Kampf?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Did you cry when he died?
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
Uh, wait ...
How many?
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
Proud?
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Then I'll be there for you.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Because ... I have to relax.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
You.  What' you're doing --
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
No I ain't.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Yes ma'am?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
We goin' in?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
You gonna drive out there?
Don't get hurt.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Well I didn't see it.
I ain't got the money.
Not like that. Not like you say.
Goin' where?
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Uh-huh.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Yes ma'am?
What makes you say that?
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
I don't need to talk to you.
Why would I care where you're going.
No. Do you?
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
How much?
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
I was just passin' the time.
Yes.
The what?
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Not any way.
I'm retired.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
It wasn't a woman.
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
A woman can write a check.
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
I know that...
Need something else?
...I... I know what you are.
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I better go check on them.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
What?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
David, please --
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!
Los Angeles, California.
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
The Five?
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
How many men have I talked to?
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
...this is your sweater, right?
Where are you going?
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Fine. You got five...
Could you give us an example?
No...
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Like what?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
What the hell was that, another statement?
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
...among others.
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
How'd they describe her?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Where? Where is she?
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
Wesley...
It just didn't fit her profile...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
What'd you get her?
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I don't know, George...
I'll think about it.
What the hell's going on?
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Better.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Did Chloe crack?
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
Okay, Everett.
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
Where's your ring, honey?
You said -
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
You didn't know that at the time!
The preacher said it absolved us.
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
An' all my meals for free...
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
I am. Hur you?
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
That's a maiden name.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Good morning, girls.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
I'm doing okay, sir.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Pardon?
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
He was. He died.
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
I'm a little late, that's all.
You what?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
That was you guys, huh?
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
He ask you out for next weekend?
He didn't give you much choice.
I'll get it if you want.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
You okay?
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
Thanks for covering for me.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
Remember that.
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
That's your problem.
They're not supposed to be here!
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
She said she did.
They're gonna die in there!
Cell phone.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
Yeah?
We'd like to come in.
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
Something's weird.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Open the door.
What am I, a five year old?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
What?
What if I keep dropping?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Tyrone...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Well... is it loaded?
You got to sit on Eldridge...
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
You got it. Berkeley?
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Jesus...
And did you witness the shoot-out?
So talk...
We appreciate your help with this.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
Huh?
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Ain't no one seen him.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
I expect to try.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
You got me beat on both accounts.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Of course, I do.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Perhaps.
Probably.
Do you see that, Colonel?
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Is that so?
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
You know how old I am.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
You learned her lessons better than I.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
No, I don't.
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
Gabriel.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
When?
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Is he really all right?
Ellie? What's wrong?
Huh?
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Allman Brothers.
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
Wendigo?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
It's Ellie's cat.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Gage's gone!
The movers--
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
I heard you tonight.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
That's forgotten.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
She.  Goes.  Free.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
I'll watch my back.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
The situation has changed.
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
Do you not know what this is, then?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
I can't breathe.
Ceremony?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Why would my father send this to me?
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
It doesn't!
You are despicable.
To freedom.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
How?  The key's run off.
It's still against the law.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
Just do it quickly.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
No, it's not.
No.
A moment.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Wheelchair accessible.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
How apropos.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Icarus?
You don't want this.
What did he want?
You're afraid of him.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
Daniel...
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
Yeah, we'll see.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
What happened to it?
Daniel!
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
Probably the caffeine.
The nanobot... it's not here...
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
You're not going after Argon!
You were looking for us?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
What in the hell?
I think I better go, Stew.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
Certainly. Right over there.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
I suppose you're going to print them?
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
Really?
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
This way.
Oh, is that so?
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
And live on your salary, I suppose?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
You what?
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
You quit trying to stop anybody
Hello, Smith.
Now don't be absurd, Smith  May I come in?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
What?
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I think it looks nice.
Bud brought it to me.
Bud?
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
All night?
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
Oh, gosh no.
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
What are you doing?
What's the matter?
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
What happened?
Well--it was dark out ...
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
I think I've got something to say.
The basketball team?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
Dan! Arrest them!
What are you doing?
No way.
It's in your closet.
What do you mean?
Jen please ...
You have no right to do this.
How come I'm still in black and white?
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
You want some berries?
Rain.
Can I open it?
McGinty's.
How much does it cost?
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Because we don't belong!
Re-runs?
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
I had nothing to do with that.
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
Where's the remote control I gave you?
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
Why don't you just take me back without it?
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
Bud?
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Bud ...
Yeah ...
Just listen to me ...
Well don't you?
What's wrong?
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
TV repair.
What happened?
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
What's the listing?
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
Are you gonna do it?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
Hi. This is Jack.
No.
Really?
Really?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Uh-huh.
No. I'm sorry.
You lied to me?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
I don't know.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure.
Ok.
Who is it?
About six months.
You were talking about the promotion --
Yeah.
Yeah.
No I didn't say that.
What happened?
There's a better place for us to eat.
Are you learning how to play it?
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
That was good.
Yeah.
Hello?
Yeah?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
This is funny.
I'm fine are you ok?
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
How?
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Please don't do this to me.
What's that for?
-- and this is confidential?
How you doin' Barry?
Hey...Lance....can I.....
Yes I'm fine.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
What do you have in the house?
Seven o'clock.
I'm serious.
You can't just stay in your house.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I thought Latisha said you would --
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
I'll go pay for my car.
We should be going --
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
There I was taxed; it's true.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
I have a proposition.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
That's enough.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
What on earth would that require?
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Oh. That.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
Most assuredly.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
What have they done to you now?
Go on, child.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
I can't
Sure
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
There. That's right.
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Sir? 
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Don't do this
I don't have it anymore?!
So, who is he? We have to know him.
They don't have to.
It's good, huh?
Shit
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Oh God.
Herman.
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
You're going to destroy it
Get out
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
I know what you want but it can't be done!
You want to do the life of Jesus?
Hey champ!
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
You know?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Jack! Enough!
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
Huh?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
Whatsa matter with you?
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Does that mean...
What time is it?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
It feels real good.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Take off my pants.
I like the gym smell.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
What's the matter with you?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Jake, no --
With Salvy, eh?
Jake --
What?
Why don't you just call him up?
No, not that.
Sure, what else is new?
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
Thanks.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
But I'm not a killer!
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Like what?
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Wrong day?
Read some good books.
I predicted it.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
I'm not ready for marriage.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
People have different emotional levels that --
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Isn't he a salesman?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
Thank heaven that's over!
Would four of them -- ?
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
You haven't even heard from him?
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
What a day I've had!
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Homework. It's more interesting.
What's the apartment house number?
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
I hate funny exit lines.
Do you like it?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Your name?
Phone number?
What's that?
Friend of yours?
What you say your name was?
Sure.  It's fine.
Any other entrance?
I think I should go home.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
What time is it?
And you dropped it?
That's funny!
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Will you let him tell it!
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
He's just loaded, honey.
He's home.  I heard the car.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Frank!
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
I'll wait for him.
What?
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
I hitched.
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Come out come out wherever you are!
There's only one key.
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
'Bye, Mom.
How!
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
If he could--
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Where what was.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I felt like it.
Where you going?
What?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
You don't need to do that.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
I never felt so clean before.
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
We were romantic then too--
I guess I just don't understand anything.
Gabriel -- !
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
I've been doing good, though.
Negative five?
No, no --
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
You're in on this.
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
He wants to see your map.
No.
But I never said Rudy.
No, you can't --
Yes!
Yes!
What's her greatest fear?
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
I did.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
Where is he?! Where is he?!
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
Monsters in the gelatin...
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Don't move, Rudy!
And you set me up.
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
That I should've picked you up?
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
What?
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Bullshit.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
How can you tell?
Did the two of you talk?
What about?
The Brewers.
Tell me more about Cabot.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Just hold on buddy boy.
It's a change.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
What for?
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Aren't you?
Your name's Freddy something.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
I can' take you to a hospital.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
No real people?
How can you be so sure?
So what is it?
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Maybe he did.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
This must have been in the family a long time.
Our kind of women?
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Like what?
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
Thanks for taking over.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
I've got eleven horses.
Where'd they go?
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
Half of them are mine.
How's that?
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
Yeah, how did you know?
All right, you didn't know.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Don't act so -- crazy.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
What's the matter -- restless?
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
Maybe I better start working on him.
I said let's go.
Would you like to learn them?
And that's tough, isn't it?
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
I found a picture of his wife.
That's it.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
Help!
Oh my God! We're dead!
It's coming!
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Maybe we can study together or something.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Listen to me I --
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
I think so.
But he'll kill her!
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
How about these buns?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
I'm sorry.
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Huh?
Oh.
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Am I cool now?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
I don't like this, this...
Saw who?!
How are we going to get them all up there?
In about fifteen minutes.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Professor, I think you should see this.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
That's right.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Yours, or the turkeys?
Alright... I might need your help.
How is she?
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
This part removes the sense of humor.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Hi, Mom.
Oh, boy! 
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Because it's the rules!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
Are you Chip Sutphin?
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
She's gonna kill Scotty!
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
We can be real quiet...
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Don't wake the kids...
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
No, I don't.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
State your name, please.
Marvin A. Pickles.
I do, please.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Certainly not!
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
I'll give you fifty cents.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
You scared?
Yes, I understand.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
About forty-five dollars.
But tell me --
Why, Mary --
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
She's a pretty good sort.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her  to see her  to touch her  in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
I'd like that.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
Could you find him?
Let her know what?
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
I don't know.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
I can imagine.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me -that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoelaces; now this sudden humility.
Wait - there is that other favor.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
But she was here?
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
Do you have other things?
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Does it bother you?
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Aren't you?
You went out with her?
And they just answer them?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
This is just... so...
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Yes.
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Why?
Have you fantasized about me?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Because.
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
I'm not either!!
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
What?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
Yes.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Fine.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
No, but I did.
You are in trouble.
I feel like I do.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
So what's my share of the dress?
No, I touched me.
I just want to know why you're here.
About what?
How do we start?
How long will it take?
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
What did he say?
Yes.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
So make an exception.
I would.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Hello.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
Student?
No.  You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
Really. How'd it go?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
God, you need help.
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
IBM.
Hi. Want a drink?
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Anything wrong?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
No? How come?
NIGHT NIGHT
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
What's cookin', Bert?
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
You got it!
Introduce yourselves.
Why Janet?
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
I'd forgotten.
Absolutely correct.
Oh my poor baby.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
Farley!
F for...
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Why are you being so defensive?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
How's it hanging, Miles?
What happened to you guys?
No, we're paying for the wine.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
That's your problem, Miles.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Shut up.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Where were you?
She's been leaving messages here too.
I will.  See ya!
What?
Understanding of what?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Nice shot.
What do you think's going on?
Huh.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
That's thoughtful.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
The plan is... you go.
What's wrong?
Look at this!
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
Maya, how are you?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I'm having the salmon.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Is she sleeping or...?
Yeah, weird. But great.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Um... yeah but it's more...
Well...
Can I ask you a personal question?
Bathroom over there?
Okay. See you around.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Victoria.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
That was big of him.
Sir, what are you doing?
That was fun last night.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
You talked to Wendy?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
A hair.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
I'm not going to curse.
Pharmacy crowded?
It's noise.
Do you feel comforted?
Merrill!
They're distracting us?
Graham.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
Sounds like a virus.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
It's like War of the Worlds.
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
...Gotta go...
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
You must have known that before you came.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
Where's Turley?
They got a saloon there?
I understand.
No hard feelings.
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
What about the law?
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
The other guy drew first.
Who is he?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
The jury saw it differently.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
What is it you want from me?
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
Who are you really?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
I know what you mean.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
Hi, Dad.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Your mother couldn't make it?
I know plenty of boys.
If anyone asks about Simone --
One thing bothered me.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Don't you?
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
What do you want -- ?
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
I don't understand.
You could play the lead.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
The only real truth is in the work.
No.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
He hates me.
Know what?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Yes.
...No.
What?
Don't cry.
Yes.
Are you wigging out?
No.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
Really?
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
Where is she?
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
I don't like people looking at me like that.
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering--
Nope.
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Bitch.
Suzie???
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
Well, there goes our record deal.
"Old Macdonald... had --"
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
He started it.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Shit.
What you up to?
Oh, yeah?
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
What can I do you for?
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
I'll get if for you.
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Hey...
You could've asked.
Why are you stopping?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
He's just exhausted.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
But you'll do it?
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
Or in the slammer.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Yeah?
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
What does the old Timex say?
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
I'm at marker eight-five.
I ran into complications.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
Yeah, but...
Breaker. Breaker.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Now, you just find him, son.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Maroon uniforms?
No.
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
Who?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
You shot me and murdered my friends.
So I guess you're not going.
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
What'd you say?
I said I got his machine.
I could have it sent out...
I am. Yeah.
Without peer?
FUCK YOU!
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...Are you insane?
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
I wouldn't go that far.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
-- okay, g'head --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
What were you doin' here anyway?
A Fed? Like FBI?
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
What'd you say?
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
What do you want?
You'll end up like me.
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
Why would you let her to do that?
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
He's dead.
Where's Sartorius?
How much sleep?
Why?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
Get out --
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Her oxygen would have run out.
I'll go with you.
Rheya...
Not a very happy poem.
Rheya.  Not here.
You go home.
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
Where've you been?
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
What's wrong.
It's all right.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
You should have told me.
I want to stop taking those pills.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
You didn't like him?
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Beg pardon?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
So it was "love".
What's to like?
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
I can't open it.
Claire...
What a memory.
"For"...?
I'll miss you, Mike.
I like your coat.
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
Your what...?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Get in bed.
You got no idea...
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
What're you talking about --
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
I just sat and listened.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Wasn't your fault.
Are you in charge here?
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
Why should she come in?
Let my kid go.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Okay, I guess.
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
Peter-- you took this picture?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
You stop him?
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Are you quite finished?
Some things you should say anyway.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
You'd feel what?
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
A match made in heaven.
Peter, you're bleeding.
How is he?
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Imagine how I feel.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Is you all good Nazis?
Jawohl.
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
That's right.
Then we're all in on it?
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
What exactly is he charged with?
Then droppen Sie dead!
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
No, Animal.
That's what I wanna hear.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Not yet.
What about Schulz?
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Says who?
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
We did it.
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
You told them, Hoffy.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Thirty-fifth.
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
Is it all right if we smell it?
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Target their Bridge.
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Are any of them inhabited?
Data, this isn't the time.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Better?
Close to retirement?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Yes.  Thank you.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Kirk here.
Maybe they're not out there.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Aye, sir.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Locate.
I don't believe it...
David!... What went wrong?
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
Logic indicates that is the case.
None that I can detect, sir.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
The word, sir?
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Who is this?! How dare you --
David?... David!
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
Genesis, I want it.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
But -- why?
Then, how --
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
What must I do?
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Sir, may I suggest --
My Lord... what are your orders?
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
That's all you have to say?
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
Where's Dr. Marcus --
It's the Genesis Wave!
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
They're still running with shields down.
No!
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Aye, sir.
She's not responding...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
It literally is Genesis...
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
The ship -- out of danger?
Any suggestions, Admiral?
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
Admiral?
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
Time!
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
I can't get power, sir!
He's not what I expected, Sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Certainly...
The question is irrelevant.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
Now wait just a damn minute.
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Can you isolate the wave?
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
So you were at Berkeley.
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
Thanks.
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Just lucky, I guess.
Hm?
What's what?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
So. There we are.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
Hey! -- Where you going?!
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
What is our target in time?
Earth... But when?... Spock?
But you said toxic.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
Why not?
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Systems report.  Communications?
Uhura!... Where!
About 60 feet, Admiral.
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
I am well, Admiral.
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Hello? Computer...?
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
They are my friends.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Why not...?
No... I want to stay with you...
The artificial lifeform was right?
And our people?
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
A planet in Federation space...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
Implants bothering you?
That's your expert opinion?
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
They're powering their forward weapons array.
Who is it?
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Counselor?
Come in.  Hi.
Why don't you try sitting up?
Augh?
Yes...
Are you saying they won't help us?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
Not yet.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
Dispersive armor is holding.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
Who are you?
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
Main bus...
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
Yes.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
There is no invasion...
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
What makes you say that?
Were the two of you... involved?
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
Captain...?
Good luck, sir.
Yes, sir.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
What are you suggesting?
Worf? Is something wrong?
Good luck, Captain.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
Still think we're finished?
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
We're explorers not diplomats!
We were until your torpedoes!
Retire.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
They'll make it look like an accident...
He's a DOCTOR!
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
For insubordination.
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
They're preparing to fire.
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Aye, sir.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
What took you so long?
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
What the -
What's she waiting for?
Uhura?
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Trouble?
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
Sir?
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Yes, please continue.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
No.
Beverly, come in.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
Is he very much like you were?
How long does he have?
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
To new worlds...
A bit less florid, Data.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
It'll only work for one of us.
Yes.
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
Negative.
Why am I looking at me?
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Open a channel.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
Aye, sir.
Sir, we're being hailed.

A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Why don't they answer our hails?
But she's not the Enterprise.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
You know I need to verify this.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
Were we always explorers?
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
I don't know.
Please.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
How long until we reach the Rift?
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
I'll have to run your card off now.
I make maps.
No!!! No!!!
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
Please...
Ah... no...
What?
Money.
Smile... good?
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
Gas good?
Go.
Closed?
Shit?
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
What is...  ...Coke?
It was yellow.
I do not understand.
No.
No.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
What is hell?
Yes.
Yes.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
There.
The yellow one.
Where do you think you're going?
They after you?
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Is it for real?
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
You get that, Lyman?
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
I don't understand.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Who did it?
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
Faith OK?
Okay... what about Strickland?
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
What clip?  What was it?
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Fumitsu.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
What is it?
Black.  Jack.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Is this great fabric or what?
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
That's where it gets a little strange.
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
This is bad.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Who's Strickland?
Got your ticket?
You see Tran?
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Um... he was older.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
Hi there.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
What?
Look...
Not bad, huh?
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Speck. Harold Speck.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
I don't believe this.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
Doesn't fit.
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
What's that?
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
I've been thinking about this.
Sue Ann Hanson.
That's true.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
Yeah, of course.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
He's moved on to TV.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
Yes, sir.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
You've been through worse.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Nikki.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
You too?
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Let me just check on my boy.
Oh my God.
No...
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
Why not?
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
I would love to see you again sometime.
I'll be around.
Hi, Mike?
I can call back...
How's it going? It's been a while...
...Six months.
Why didn't you call?
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
It's a gig.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
I didn't want to say anything.
You want to hit the town tonight?
I'll give you an eight. 
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
Darwinism at its best.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
Oh, like that song...
I got to at least try once.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
It's kinda money, actually.
Don't call me ever again.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Wait.
What?
She smiled baby.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
What?!?
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
I gotta use the phone.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Don't remind me.
What?!?
What?
I'm sorry.
We got the digits, baby.
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
No.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...honestly...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...Shut up, Sue...
It's on.
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
I'm not hungry yet.
You heard about your father?
Understood.
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
How?
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
Godfather, you understand everything.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
Beautiful all over, eh?
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
They're talking to themselves.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
Please say it.
How's Mom?
Send some bodyguards.
Cut it out.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
Is he alive?
We?
No, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
It's just an undercoat. 
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
And Rome.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
I didn't mean with you in it.
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
Tom, I don't love you.
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Do you think you can steer this thing?
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
What about Christmas?
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
I'm well, thank you.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
I think it might hurt her to know.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Okay.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Tom?
Marge? Where are you going?
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
What?
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
You're kidding.
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Ditto.
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
I'm fine.
Hello. What are you up to?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
Even her.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
How much for everything.
You like ball games?
I can believe that.
What kind of people?
You must be rich.
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
What are you doing?
But this is a porno movie.
Damn.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Keep it.
Yeah.
More people watch it.
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
He's Black, OK?
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Betsy, come over here a moment.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Where.
You can do it in my mouth.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Where?
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You just gonna leave 'em?
I sure hate to go alone...
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Education?
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Neither do I, I guess.
I'm a field agent.
Wrong.
Womack ripped it up, right?
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
How'd it go?
Whoa.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
Do you have the...
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Exactly.  And he got good.
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Here we are.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
No.  But...
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
You bet.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
The film broke...
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Anybody take it?
The G-man?
Zackly.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Any idea how you got here, son?
Call me... Ishmael?
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
I was decorated.
Luke didn't smoke.
I taught you that.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
Oh...
What happened?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
Ancestors?
No.  Absolutely not.
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
It's a lovely garden.
Yes.
If you have some, I'd...
What do you mean?
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
She already has a daughter.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Good morning.
And the white house?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Of course.
I need her exact name, you see.
Young woman cut herself.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
Oh. I see.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
I'm simply quoting the law.
How long have you known her?
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
Sixty...  Oh.
What?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Are they moulting now?
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
We met in court.
What are you? A policeman?
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Yes, but...
Famished.
Oh, yes.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Without any clothes on?
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, I was lying.
I wrote the letter.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
What do you want ?
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
Hear!
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Melanie...
Don't let's take any chances.
I keep thinking of Annie. 
And he'll talk?
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
There we are!
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Do you have any lovebirds?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
How do you plan to do that?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Mr. Gray?
But can't you give me any idea?
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
I can't believe that.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
But can anything be done for her?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
You've been with Gray again.
I hate that picture.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
The strip joint?
Think maybe knives do?
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Sssshhh. She's resting.
Fucking Zombie.
Fuck. Me.
You're him. Corvis.
Yeah, no kidding.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
Are you ok?
My father.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
It's ok, it's ok...
You know.
How about sign of a big black bird?
What's with your friend there?
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
What were you yelling about?
What? What is it?
You're in with them.
You killed her!
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Are you an FBI man?
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
You think they'll ever find him?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
Did all these people die in wars?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
I was only hoping to make you understand.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
What is it you want?
Why not?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
No. That's all finished.
That's right.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
But I suppose you know the answer.
I don't like horror comics.
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
They're gaining on us!
Good.
The meanest!
Where is she?!
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
What?
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
... And stay outta here.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
He's just a deep sleeper.
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Are you following me?
Then it's not too late for us...
This room is mine.
What happened, Michael!?
Sixteen.
What do you want from us?
Dogs don't eat each other.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
It's shorted out or something!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
The dogs?
Not the only one.
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
After all this mess then.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
You reach anybody yet?
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
This storm do that?
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
What is it?
You jerking off or just pissed?
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
What's happened?!
Now how did you get hurt?
Ah... no.
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
But you're only a mud carrier.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Sir... have you a name?
You know of them?
Do you know where they live?
When was his mother taken?
Last night.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
Yes...
What's it all for?
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
We make them see what we wish.
But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
I don't think that's going to happen.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
You know I can't.
Let's walk through the park...
Do you know you were humming?
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Where's the challenge in that?
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
Oh?
What is it?
Good night, David.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
Thank you...
Did you hear me, lad?
You're not from beyond the valley.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
How long ago?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
It's undamaged?
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Oh, I'm already swooning.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Might I ask why?
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
Why?
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
We choose to believe it.
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
Sir, if I may --
If I might explain, sir --
Yes, sir.
No, you're safe --
They're inside --
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
Should we be...
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
How did you come to know their names?
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Did you know my father?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Jackie, go play in the snow.
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
But no one knew until after...
Yes.
I know.
I know.
Why?
I don't know.
Me, too.
You're sure?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
Good. How's your mom?
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
Why, what would you do?
What case?
How'd he get it?
[Beat] I don't know.
What do you mean?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
What were you talking about the other day?
It's gonna be sticky.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
You like it?
Yes, baby?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Why?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
That sounds nice.
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Can't it go to any office?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Can I just ask you one other thing?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Thelma!
Louise.  Where are we going?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
I'm cash poor.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
Call him?
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Will I be?
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
You mean now or before?
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
Yeah, you want it?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
Shit!
Shit!
You're a good friend.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
Where?!
Are you going to apologize or not?
Yeah... sure did.
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
The thing's kind of heavy.
So you admit it?
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
His mother?
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
What?
No You mean...?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
You know, clean the pipes.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Mary.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
Healy you dog!
Here's the info you asked for.
Thanks.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Healy, what I just tell you?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Same here again.
Don't you want to know my name?
I already know it, Mary.
I work with retards.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
That...? Vestibule.
Lint?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
I guess.
Are you okay?
Uh-huh.
All you want is a phone number?
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
So she hasn't changed?
Four kids, three different guys.
Jai alai?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Harvard?
Four.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
What's a mook?
Why?
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Pat's an architect, too.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Hi, Ted.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Hi, Ted.
Well... why don't you move back?
Why not?
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
What what are you doing here?
But but what about Steve?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
What?! No please, sir --
So what's up?
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Piggyback ride.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
The other thing is...
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
Yes it is.
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
Max.
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
Dean Rusk!
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
I was eating that.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
I don't care. Cancel it.
What's that?
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
Just a second, Mr. President.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
Who is he?
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
Bastards...
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
What?!
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
What did he say?
What's he smoke in that?
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
Sorry.
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
This Jimmy's?
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
Good.
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
How so?
I thought he'd never leave.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
I can't.
What if he's not?
Used to what?
I'm different.
Anything.
You don't have to kill it.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
You're totally insane.
And now?
Take something off.
I was, later.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Yes, Sergeant?
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
MAVERICK.
He better be kidding!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
What is?
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Ohhh Mother!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
No! Not again!
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
You ever done this before?
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
I'm pinned to the panel.
That's Kazanski.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
A plaque?
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
GET LOST!
I guess I owe you one.
Figured it out yet?
Figured out what?
It was bad.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir..
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
You may not think so, but you are.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Thank you.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Amazing.  Where are we?
Suppose I do...then what?
You're Kuato, right?
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
No shit...
Come on, let's go have that drink.
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Just think about it.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
The hell you're not.
It was implanted by the Agency.
Implanted.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
What's in the two week package?
How real does it seem?
All right.
I thought you didn't like me.
Not bad, for a hooker.
Like what?
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
Oh my God.
You didn't cook breakfast?
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Why?
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Well, sure.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
Oh, Jesus!!
You're hung up again.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
What the hell are you doing?!!
What?
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
Burt!  Heather!
And I appreciate it.
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
You okay?
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
True.
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
No. No...
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
You really think that's what happened?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
That's why I hate experts.
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
A fucking wheelchair?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
-- Find him?
I haven't paid you.
Got any booze in the house?
I killed the motherfucker.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
-- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
Oh come on, Cecil.
No, s-sir.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
No... No, go away.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
I'm nearly out.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
An old woman and her grandson.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
And neither will I.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Where is the ring?
How come Jack let's you work here?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
I don't know what to do.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Call me.
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Hey, Jacques...
I am The Muffin.
We're on our way, Baby.
We were supposed to be together.
You want to see...
See what?
You're getting warmer.
Can I take the car?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Good night, Mom.
Dad.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Leland...
Did you get this from your lover?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Nothing.
Four cases in three years...
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
It's a crime.
Yes.
I... yes.
I'm on the staff of...
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
Ed Concannon.
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
No further questions.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Yes.
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
I am seventy-four years old.
I am on the staff of...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
One hour.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Laura.
Maybe I can do something right.
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
Yes.
Not if you don't grow up...
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I've got nothing to say to you.
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
Are you out of your mind...?
Who have we got?
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
You got a good memory, Franky.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
What happened, Joey...?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
In New York?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
We'd be in all the papers!
There's nobody left around here now.
You look kinda lost yourself.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Is that... machine...?
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
Right.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Must be somebody in there.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Which means he's having nightmares again?
Can I read it?
I don't follow.
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
Heather?
Like Freddy.
No.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
Who?
What...what is that?
In what, a romantic comedy?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Really?
I'm sorry, I can't.
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Me?  Why me?
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
That was Nancy, not me!
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Now?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
He would have loved this.
You sound so sure.
What?
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Make us proud.
Where's Mom?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
Figured what out?
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
Why'd you do it?
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
No, I didn't.
I feel like I got you into this.
My dad.
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Jesus, you never told them?
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Shouldn't we turn away?
Can't do it.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
What is it we can do for you today?
Who is it Philip?
Son-of-a-bitch.
Immortality.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
Why'd you jump?
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
It hurts too much to care.
How long you been standing there?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
No.
No, sir.
Joy, rapture...
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
Yes.
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
What's Cao Ben?
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
Used to.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
No sir...
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
In what capacity?
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
What happened to him?
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
What'd you say to her?
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
Got anyplace special in mind?
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Who do?
Who knows, baby?
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
Oh shit...
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
Lula, you there?
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
It's a comfortin' idea.
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
Now what?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
So where'd you say you was?
Uh-huh?
What?
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
Santos... It isn't.
You need to explain it.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
By who?
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
He said something about being between things.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
You stay there.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Kidnapped? By who?
It's a little late to call Admissions.
So what's the problem?
...we find the jacket.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
I passed out.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
A little.
You?
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
The guy on the phone.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Professor Tripp?
But James. I mean... How long?
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
What kind of dancer?
When we fall, we fall hard.
Kinship.
Kinship. And what's here?
It feels really... good... here.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
I'm not going with them.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
I got the message you called.
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
Really? That was fast.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
About the baby.
Ouch. How many?
James is... I don't know...
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
Listen, Antonia --
He's writing his name in water.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
I... I...
What is it, Grady?
I'm in love with your wife.
Holy shit. Are you serious?
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Where you stand?
You want to keep him happy.
Foreman now.
What?
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
What are you doing?
You need a table.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
Is that right?
You always carry these?
How does it sound?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Hiya, Walter.
Okay?
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
Do you believe in them?
The one with the ax?
What?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
I count my blessings.
It gives me headaches.
Do you have many friends?
It sounds like you were banished.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Yes?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
Why not?
I don't understand.
Bad idea.
Try it.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
We have a few more minutes.
We have a lot of work to do.
Do you know what "normal" is?
How do they know?
I want to be normal!
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
Go home, Walter.
When did it all start?
You mean my problem?
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
I'm relaxed.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
Where are you?
But roughly, how old?
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
Did you get an erection?
Time.
What picture?
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
You're quiet at work.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
You must hate it.
What about bears?
I'm not easily shocked.
Why do you want to know?
I suffer from insomnia.
You're not joking.
Sorry.
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
I've changed.
You're scared.
Just think about it.
I say we call it quits.
I heard they were filthy birds.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
You got it?!  You got it?
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
You never did like being called that, did you?
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
We've only got one suit.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
How many are there?
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
Uh, oh...
Stand by on the ROV.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
A little more so this time.
But how could you say such a thing?
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
You already know what they are.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
That must be Basiluzzo.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Nothing... nothing at all!
Any news?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
And why did you drop them?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
Then I'll see you later.
I'm too sleepy.
I don't love you.
You say that just to flatter me.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Where is she going?
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Giulia...
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Are you the owner of this place?
Whose boat is that?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
No.
No.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
It's a sin to be fat.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Yes, Mother.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Well, who in particular?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Who?
Oh, yes!
You've been alone together?
At least once a week.
Why should they?
Where?
And what did you do?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Would you like to ask them?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Would you like some?
I can't have them any more.
Why do you smoke?
You liked Sister Paul?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
Agnes...
Did your mother see angels often?
No.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
Why not?
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
That you're a mistake?
How does she know that?
Are you pretty?
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Why were you afraid?
Would you like to tell me?
She made me promise not to.
We went to chapel for vespers.
My bed.
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
She said Michael.
Him.
Are you frightened?
No...
She took the baby in her arms?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Marty, what are you doing here?
Marie's dead Mama.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
The one up on the third floor?
Two packs a day.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
And you weren't shocked?
Not simple, no.
You hate us don't you?
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
Aquittal.
The sheets...
Oh God, if only I'd known.
Because I didn't know... 
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
An unhappy woman...
Bullshit!
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
Oh, don't do this!
They're yours.
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Just you?
Yeah?
Ever seen one of these before?
I've made the scene.
We're nearly there, sir.
Me? Why?
Of course I can.
Get him out of here!!
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Sorry.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
They ought to be.
What are you?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Pity.
See you.
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
What?
Eh?
And we're looking after him, are we?
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
No, that's his other one.
What little old man?
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Behave...
What's he know?
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Ah, go on, you swine.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
My eyes are lighter.
What have you heard?
He's betrayed the class.
Temper! Temper!
I've got the stuff. Come here.
Yeah, you want to watch it.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
He's been gone a long time.
What?
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Yeah.  Two hours.
Gravity?
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
What's the terrain down there?
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
This is Chaz.
What is it?
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Yeah!
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
What the hell's going on?
Hurt!  How?
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
Don't count on it.
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
First contact...
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
It's stopped?
No, thank God... just missed him.
They're on the next level up.
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
It's out of focus.
Any microorganisms?
Still worried?
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Where did the parasites come from?
Food-storage room!
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
Now what?
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
I'll get you out of there.
Headache?  Dehydration?
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Where is she?
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
When?
Deal.
Listen to what?
Whoa, wait a minute...
Hold it, hold it...
What happened?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Is this the suit?
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Yeah.  Somebody won.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
It needn't be.
Hungry?
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
What do you mean by that?
A dull cliche.
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
What of it?
I'm tired. I want to go home.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Just slipped your mind.
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill...
Where?
Thank you so much.
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
Huh?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
That I am...
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
I'll check with Eve...
I don't think that's funny!
It's all over.
Addison-!
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Here we go...
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
Well, I am.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Hello, what's your name?
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Why.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
What have I got to do with it?
You're quite a girl.
What did you expect - live sables?
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Subway.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
I don't intend to be.
But the raves about your performance-
- an understudy's performance.
I'll never get over it.
Congratulations, Eve.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
Did you see it here in New York?
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Really, Eve? Why?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Harrington.
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
How much time have we?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
With gestures, of course.
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
Now just a minute-
Well of all-
Who is it? What's it all about?
Where is she?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
To you, too?
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
You know, she probably means well, after all...
That depends.
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
"Liebestraum."
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Well...
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
July of '71.
Goddamnit--
Who'd you vote for?
--we will--
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
It's nothing personal, though. 
--jeeeeeeesus--
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
I'm so glad.
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
Donald Segretti?
But you know who did.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
--you got more than one source?--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
I think.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
How senior?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
What I don't understand is how you got here.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Yes, sir.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Haldeman too?
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
I did all right on McCord.
Who's Charles Colson?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
That was awhile ago.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
Good morning gentleman.
This.  Right now.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
Stifler told me.
You talked to Stifler?
So you're going to Michigan?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
This isn't any better, Chris.
...I've never tried it.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
No comment.
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You think she was serious?
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Jim?
Dad!!
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Yes.  Seriously.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
...excuse me?!
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
This was remade?  Into what?
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Well...uh...
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
Okay, explain.
Kevin, it was just a --
That junior chick?
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Keep it down, dude.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Ha-ha!
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
Are you crazy!?
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Didn't even have to ask.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
Before the coma!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
Uncle Terrence?
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Not that I know.
What've you got?
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Hurry, Grandmama!
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
I'm going to stretch my legs
Just what do you think you're doing?!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
What a beautiful ship!
Why does everyone have to act that way?
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
You're a princess...
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Come on.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
Yeah? Allison what?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
Alvy, I...
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Well, where is it? I-
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Sylvia Plath.
Duane?
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
I know.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Yeah.
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
No.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Look, look at that guy.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Really?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Yeah.
Sinatra?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
What's- It's me, open up.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Oh, Jesus, really?
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
God, it's so clean out here.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Thanks, honey.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
Oh, I'm sorry!
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
Are you?
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Yes.
Just give me the license, please.
You're crazy!
Forget it, Max.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
You all right?
You like this house, Max?
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
V.P.L.?
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
M'hm.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
She was stealing.
SO?
All right-so we can afford it.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
...of possibly working together.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Yeah.
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
Why didn't you bring him?
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Harry called.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
There's a test, you know.
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah?
Let me heal you, baby.
I call that a perfect day.
Hey!  Would you?
There's still time to undo this.
We'll be fine.
You're out of your mind.
Accept a compliment.
No.  I missed that.
What?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
It's an unfair advantage.
Truce?
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
She left the fucking gate open.
Otis!!!!
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Cal, too?
Don't do this!
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
It's a novel.
The infamous dog?
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
Very well put.
I will treasure this.
Medallions.
Yes.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
Of course it's alright.
How's he doing?
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
I don't need a drug.
Ready to go?
We could hardly say no.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
That was my clue.
Really??
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Panes is here!
Like your business managers?
Like the last time.
Okay.
We're just feeling our way back.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
Why not?
I never like to talk about my work.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
Nevermind.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
The both of you.
Oh Soph...
And the food sucks, I know.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
We're going to die!
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
...Not enough food?
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
Twenty-seven.
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
How is your cold?
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
Oh.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
No -- I like it.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
I think so.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
As soon as I can walk.
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
I am. Let me get the cards.
Cut.
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
That's terrible.
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
Are we dressing for dinner?
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
What?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
I don't?
I'm fine all over.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
I don't know.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
Where is your apartment?
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
Oh, yes. Thanks.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
You're going to take her off my hands?
Mine?
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
How's that again?
No key!
I dig.
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
What's her name?
Any of that coffee left?
How do you spell her last name?
Well, I have things to do --
Who is Mickey?
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
Good night.
Dreyfuss.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
You didn't really believe me, did you?
Are you sure that's what you want?
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Now, Fran --
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
Atlantic City?
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
Dreadful.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
My men --
We've been attacked.
North ?
Yeah. Way north.
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
How long were you up there ?
Not a thing.
... he's an amazing officer.
What'd he say?
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Listen.
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
What cat  ?
I only met Kurtz once.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Terminate ?
Charlie?
Charlie?
Who is he?
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
American weapons?
We don't want to bother you any, we --
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
What, sir?
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
I got bored in Saigon.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
I'm Kurtz.
You were not coming here, to see me?
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
Do you?
You can't have water after morphine.
I can handle it.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
Fuck no.
And you admired him?
Are you finished surfing?
You think he'd of shot us?
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What things?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Well who the hell verifies that ?
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
30   CONTINUED:
Avalanche season is coming.
212  CONTINUED:
Had?
Oh.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
Why?
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
Did you catch Corbett?
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
What's going on?
You're hurt.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Been driving long?
That's right.  You're not.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
Forget it.  It would take days.
You don't feel cold?
Stay still.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
Thought that door was open last night...
...Ben never sent a signal.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
There's what they're waiting on!
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Don't be silly. How bad?
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
No.
Spencer.
Sorry.
What about your mother?
Why did yo do this for me?
What needs clearing up?
Thank you.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
I don't want to hear that music right now.
That seems like a good choice.
Go ahead.
Boyfriend?
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Shall I get her for you?
Terrify me?
Is he dead yet?
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Did you... do something to him?
Come on, sweetheart...
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
That's very thoughtful.
What did she say?
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Where you from?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You can't --
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
Okay.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
Um, five.
I work for the government.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
An assassin?
Another contractor.
Someone hired both of you?
Because he is trying to retire me.
He wants to kill you?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Yeah.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
You were like a boy genius?
Oh.  What do you think about?
Not even a stalemate?
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Do you think he's here?
Sorry.
Taiwan.
Two way?
Check.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
We split the money?
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
You didn't take it.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
No?
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Martin.
What?
Electra --
Was nice.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
Sometimes.
Thank you.
Can I ask you something?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Can I ask you a question?
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
But we are underground?
What did the beer cost?
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
He was an electrician?
That makes you an expert I guess.
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
Thought of everything haven't you.
But how did the wall get here?
I'd love to get in there.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
No beer?
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
No, not yet.
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
And a tram hit you?
Chris, can you do me a favour?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
So I hear.
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Now you're using that word.
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
You're sure?
Yeah, pretty well.
There shooting at something.
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
No, I love you, really.
Hi, want to take up dancing?
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
How do I know what's being said?
You will wish you hadn't.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
We had a deal!
Hey Doug, where you been?
A drill, what are you up to?
No problem, is it at your place?
Josh!
Shall I look after the rest?
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
She's coming over here...
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
I'm sorry about how we --
And I have no idea why.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Out with Belinda?
Thanks.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
Landon --
Deranged.
She's like some Puritan.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
I'm very sorry --
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
Oh. Just not at school...
He okay?
I haven't been nice to you.
Why not?
Is there a rush?
I have to get you home by one.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
Where?
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
What'd you tell your father?
Where's the one you're building?
No.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Help me live until I die?
How're you doing?
Can I -- go out?
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
You came here to give me my report card?
How was school today?
Learn anything?
Here's your jacket!
What time does school start around here?
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
'Bike fine point?'
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
I'm going to be at the dance.
Why?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
I know.
You didn't?
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
What year is this?
What do you call this? 
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
No way!
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
What did you do to your hair?
What'd they look like?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
You lost that one?
Mmmmm.
You like people?
Hi.
What're you doing?
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Nah, I got me a job.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
You said that once already... Too late now.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
That's Montana over there.
It was going too fast.
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Really?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
You keep an eye on it.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
It's a spittin' image.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
How d'ya like your room!
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
...Huh? No, I'm 
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected 
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
I didn't say anything-
To see pap.
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
...Barton, is everything okay?
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Charlie. How are you.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact  New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
So they say.
Why don't we go to your room-
What do you think happened?
...I just don't know what... to do
Yeah... rye whiskey?
Mr. Lipnik, I 
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Fink.
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
All of which he's now missin'.
Mr. Lipnik, I 
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Where were you tonight?
Yeah, I was drinking.
There's no smoking in this building.
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
No?
Who?
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
Sure.
Why not?
I passed.
Am I... disturbing you?
She wiped out her whole family.
Aren't you going to thank me?
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
Why?
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
Do you remember his name?
Who was this fuckin' guy?
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I'm not afraid of her.
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
I'm going with you.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
What was the motive?
Are you kidding me?
She killed him.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
Do you ever get sick of it?
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Saddle River, New York!
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
What's wrong?
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
No.
How do you know?
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Still not here.
 In this corner?
SAMO.
You got a date already?
I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
About what?
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry  fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
Who's John Henry?
You gonna carry that around all night?
I ain't John Henry.
I don't really have any problems.
No, don't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
It's Monday morning.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
I'm your family.
... babies.
Hi.
What's that?
How is he?
Me? Why?
Hi.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
You don't have any!!!
I just don't think you're being fair.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
I will relay the message.
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
... What do we do?
Your blood, Max.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
... eight, seven...
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Please be looking for me.
Alfred's happy here.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
You're loosing your cool
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I was just hanging around.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
No beauty...
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Winded, old timer?
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
And?
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
And she did it all for me.  For love.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
No gun.  How disarming.
Where is my wife?
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
It'll never work.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
He ran away?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Just checking, young sir.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
My life's an open book. You read?
You are direct, aren't you?
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
So glad you could come.
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
What do you know about obsession?
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
What?
What are you talking about?
Okay. I'm outta here.
You can't-.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
...You gonna kill me?
A man with a death wish.
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
... How long have I been out?
I loathe bats.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
No one would miss me.
Finding out where she is.
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
MOVE! Can't you do something??
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
I understand.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
That's it?
Joker here. Can we talk?
... Thank you.
... Why the mask?
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
HOLY SHIT!!
You okay?
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
Scottish.
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Liar.
David, I'm serious!
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Big day today, huh? 78
Yes, isn't he.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
David, David, David ...
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
And a car.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Yes?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Damn, huh huh.
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
That was boring. Huh huh.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
You see what I see, Bork?
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Anything happen while I was away?
Maybe this is heaven.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
She's only fourteen...
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
What...?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
Did you get the paint?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
All right.  Who are you?
Just get some people out of our house.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
Our cemetery?
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Where'd they go?
Are you a spirit too?
I think so.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
What?
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Okay?
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Their wedding clothes.
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
... And please call me Robert.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
Stay here? Is that necessary?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Do you know Raphael?
Oh. I have a message for him.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
May I ask your name?
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
I see.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Does it have a television?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
I live here.
How were you paid?
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Yes, I will.
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... In the garden?
Yes. I will.
... Nothing.
... Ben, really...
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Yes? What have you found?
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
This is not what I requested.
... So what does all that add up to?
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
Yes, I did.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
The monkey.
Is the trial date set?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
I want to try.
Now?
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
No they're not.
What's that?
What about Maxine?
And he was with her.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
The monkey.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Sure, after a fashion.
Schwartz.
No. I understand perfectly.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Yessir.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Yes, well...
No, really.
Yeah.
Somebody told you.
The usual, Barry.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
Hi.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Hello. Wendy.
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
No.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
No you mustn't, my child.
No.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
I have to see you.
What's the play?
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Great then.
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
You mean with Malkovich?
Vegas.
You've got to be kidding.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
I want somethin' sweet.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Back stiff?
No, let her rest.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Won't you be late for work?
MAMA!
Was over to Baby Suggs.
True.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
Leave off..
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Yeah?
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
This is our concern, Dude.
I know my rights.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
Sheesh.
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Am I wrong?
Those are good burgers, Walter.
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
He's handicapped, huh?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Shit yeah, the achievers.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Jeffrey.
Oh?
Jeffrey--
I want a child.
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
So who--
Donny!  Please!
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
The fucking point is--
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
Wooden bridge, huh?
Walter!
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
That's it.  I'm out of here.
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
The nail polish, Walter.
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
But Walter--
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Huh?
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Uh-huh.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Is this your homework, Larry?
Huh?
Walter, you fuck!
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
Dude, I'm sorry--
Yeah.
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Huh?
Who the hell is he?
Shit, sorry man.
Am I wrong!?
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
You happy, you crazy fuck?
You come all the way down here to roust--
He's half yours, partner.
Two years.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
For what?
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
You're hurting me.
How does it look?
Where were you, Whistler?
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Not that I'm in contact with.
Tell me something, Skid --
Going on twenty years now.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
But I just got here --
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Some kind of archive --
Are you all right?
Is it bad?
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
I was afraid that might happen.
I don't believe that.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
How many of you are there?
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
What -- ?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
He killed them?
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
Inside the grave?
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
What's she look like?
Druid Hill Park.
What?
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
I want to see something!
Why?
You have to go.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
Too busy eating us?
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Boy Kurth.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
<u>What</u>?
Let's get inside.
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
What?
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What'd you see?
He'll never know.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Does she, goddamnit??
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
What?
I could've sworn I heard something.
Hello?
Ray--
...Where is everything?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...So what're you doing tonight?
We don't seem to be communicating--
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Back where?
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
What did you take these for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
I didn't say that.  Well?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
...Count it if you want.
Red Label.
What's the point?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
What is this? What color is it?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Well.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Don't say that.
Does that scare you?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Shh. I'll tell you.
They hurt his head.
Heineken.
That's too bad.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Why not?
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Okay. okay.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
NO.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
My father has a gun at home.
Probably not. no. Why?
Go ahead.
Hi Dad.
God. you scared me.
Well.
No. you're right.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Motherfucker works fast.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Nothing like this back home.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Tuna, this is crap.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
What can I do for you guys?
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
Yeah.  She told me.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
I would if I could get some sleep.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
Yeah, I'm out.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
Good to see you, Diego.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
George.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
There's no room.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
Today.
G-d, son.
It would be my pleasure.
Un sapo?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
I want money.
Power?
Yeah, maybe.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
I know.
What are you going to do?
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
George.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
What are you doing here?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
What?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Okay, George.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
For instance, something like this?
Very nice.  I'll take it.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Yeah?
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
Sid Ahmed.
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
It could've happened to anyone.
Why?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
Take some time off.
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
So she knew about his heart?
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
Yes.
Did they argue the day before he died?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Yes.
Who found him?
She was here?
For about one year.
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
It didn't.
Why do you think she left you?
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
What kind of information?
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
-- And what did you suggest?
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Why does she come to you?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
High school?
I heard him say it.
Then -- those are not your own words?
What happened next?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
That bastard!
No.
Yes.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
You know I can't talk about that.
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
Yes -- it would be nice.
What?
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
I'm dropping the case.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
Really?
If you want me to.
She sounds like quite a woman.
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
No.
I don't know.
It had to get there somehow.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Carolyn!
She's changed.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
You want me to call the doctor?
Pretty country.
No.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Maybe it's because I live here.
Are you from Washington originally?
Oh. When did you move back?
This time of year.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Feeling better?
Help cook?
Then what happened?
When?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
You must get lonely at times.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
I told you, I love other people.
No. But I love them just the same.
What made you ask such a question?
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Francesca?
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Yes.
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
No. I couldn't.
Uh-huh. And?
Where was she?
Long day. Go to sleep.
Well, what is this?
Stop it!
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
But now that you have it -
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Okay.
Betty.
What's she like?
Apparently just before her death.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
'S up?
You think that's really him?
Shit.
Where's the others?
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Wh-wh-whooo?
But.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
I lied.
Are they on the radio?
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
I'm here.
What are we doing down here?
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Please...help me...
What building?
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
Open the case!
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
Gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
There's no time.
It was him.  I'm positive.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
Got to think this through ...
Violet, please!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
Caesar, this is crazy.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Fuck.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Stupid cunt!
What did she do to you?
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
But everybody is all right.
Yes, I understand.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
What?  How about a drink?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Where is it?
No.
Are you okay, Violet?
What?  They ain't there?
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Me?  Why?
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
You're doing everything yourself?
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
Caesar is your husband?
No.
I guess I wanted to.
What are you afraid of?
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
I don't.
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
How much money?
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
Is that what you think?
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
Yeah.
Then what?  Exactly.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
What if he doesn't run?
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
Yes.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
-- he went inside! --
-- if we can get a clean shot --
I'm going to Paris.
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
I won't ask again.
Treadstone?
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
I don't know.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
Right.
Look, maybe I should just...
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --

I need a ride out of here.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
I don't know.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
Where?
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- just --
-- let me do this, okay? --
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
-- how? --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
Nykwana Wombosi. 
xxxxxx
Where's the dog?
-- and they're sure it's him? --
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
You drink rum?
You telephone, sir.
...elephoned sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
I think we'd better have a look.
It's reply paid.
Her name is Jill.
Layton.
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
You are late.
Triplets.
Er, I knew you looked different.
Layton! Oh shit!
Am I?
Not much.
Out of kindness.
And you're mine.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Oh.
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
Them?
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
I didn't like it.
Why not?
Really.
Every day?
Security.
Shit! The house is on fire!
Leave me alone!
Your face ... are you hurt?
Where are you going?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Would you really, Sam?
The refund for Tuttle!
Tuttle?
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
I did it for you.
This is your dream girl, is it?
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
No need, sir
Now look what you've done to him.
What is it?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
Pregnant.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
He looks like a cop.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
I guess I'll be going.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
You're not going to die.
At least he's got people around him.
I think this place stinks.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
Not as good as Nino's.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Don't seem so bad to me.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Maybe I should come up with you.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
He got better.
What do you think?
The family know?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
How can that be? He was getting better.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
Oh no!--I just remembered.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Don't push it, Larry.
Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
Oh, God, no!
You packing up tonight?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Yes.
Ravenous homosexual.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Yes.
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
I didn't know you were going with him.
As good as humanly possible.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
I'm not kidding.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
Move away from me.
How long has it been since you've been home.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Goodbye, Paul.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
We could...
Should I...
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
I wish it were you giving the story.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
I had no idea she was this good.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I didn't think you'd make it.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Nooo.  Is it your story?
I know.  I taped it.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
How can you say that to me?
Then give me a minute...
Why?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
I got promoted for things like that.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
That's not true I am a sculptor!
What are you doing here?
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Um...
Alright we're clear.
Anything new?
See you later -
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Hi Walter...
Nothing...nothing at all.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Well I was uh, just looking...
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
I didn't mean to.
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Hiya Carla.
You know what that proves?
Well...why murdered man?
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Hello, Walter.
You're like an undercover guy!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
You're gonna shoot me!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
After that we go no more!
Well, I'll go home with you.
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
What's all the noise in here!
I don't think this is gold.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Suck!
You're the guys from the movie!
You didn't like them.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Would you sleep with them?
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Which way did she go?
What show is this?
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
No, you didn't.  When?
You want some water or something?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
Yeah?
I know.
Why'd you come back?
Dress, huh?  What for?
For the dance.
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Bugs.
Let's meet tonight, okay?
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Just stay away from me, okay?
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
Meet me at this address after school.
Not a pressing issue.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
But you threw a knife at my head!
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
It isn't important.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
Vampires of the world, beware.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
I want to die.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
No THX.
Thank you very much.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Pike.
Hi.
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
You're kidding.
Buffy!
The homelesses?
Oh, thank you very much.
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
I don't think so.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
You said "Crash".
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
What?
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
A little better.
Nuke?!
Just till I lose.
I know what it is.
I knew it--you're seducing me!
--but you're father's in there!
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
He' s confused--
It's possible.
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Ninety-three miles an hour.
God bless you.
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
I got him on the knee!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Beg me!
What do I got?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was playing naked.
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
Write this down.  "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
You're a great catcher.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
What?
No.
Don't try me.
Well tell 'em, honey.
Ain't he warning up?
Struck out eighteen...
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
Liar.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Yeah.
702 472 1862.
When did this happen, honey?
They payin'?
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
Okay.
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
My wife?
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Please...
Okay?
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
Hello.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Right away. Okay?
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
It's chinchilla.
Okay.
Oh, fabulous.
Yeah, how do I know?
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
Okay, okay.
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
...twenty-five thousand?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
She had the same.
Why do you want to do that?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Listen to me.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
That's amazing.
All right, I will, I will.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
This is not the way to treat people.
A record of the arrests...
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
You just - Just stop him.
All right. Okay, okay.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Hey, Frankie.
I'll take care of it, Remo.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Tell me.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
What? What?
I don't - 
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get the fuck out of here.
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
I think that's it.
I took care of everybody.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Yeah.
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Ch-Charlie M!
Charlie M?
Charlie M.
You sure?
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Since when do you talk like that?
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
I better go report this in...
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
I actually got some memory back last night.
How much?
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Next time, call...
What?
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
You seem sad, Spooky.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
Nice breasts.
You could've made me lose my call.
Say something ...
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Let's have your license, mister.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
You switched license plates?
And stop with the directions.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
I don't want to know --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
I'm with two friends now.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Hey drop it, okay?
What do you do for a living?
Pictures.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
That makes two of us.
Does she wear glasses?
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
No.
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Yes?  Yes?
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
Yes.
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Damned if I know.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Got a phone in that van?
Just relax.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
It's in the process.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Stop the crying.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Seems not.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Government business?
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
Saw that one.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He agreed that he was.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Good thing in a man.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Everybody wants something.
Not me.
You all right?
You want me to ask you in, right?
Why?
Drink.
Depends what it is.
I'm thinking of your man.
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Must be.
Ask to meet me again.
Am I becoming repetitious?
Please, Jimmy.
Happy now?
Shouldn't be, Dil
She own you, Jimmy?
I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?
You want another haircut, baby?
It's a secret.
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
And you'll never leave me?
Tell me what she wore.
You've got to go now, Dil --
Fergus.
You know her, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Need to lose myself awhile.
She's nobody. She likes me.
Of course. I forgot.
Thanks.
Back in a minute, Jody
And who's Dave when he's at home?
Good. So what do you think?
Right.
Am I?
You trying to hurt my feelings?
What do you know about my nature?
And you know the funny thing?
No?
You make a nice couple.
What the fuck am I doing here.
Shut up, would you?
Where would you most like to be now, man?
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
The best.
I've often wondered how you do it.
It's as simple as that?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
How can I?
When I was a child...
Take the hood off, Fergus --
What if I did?
Come and get me, soldier --
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
That's right.
What?
When you come on, you really come on.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
You mean spies and things like that?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Agent.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Oh.
No, what?
Carson?
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Steal it how?
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Yes -- ?
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
No.
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Your --
Would you like to see my passport?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
What's so illogical about that?
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Reggie -- open the door.
Well!
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
How much is it worth?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
You sure nuthin's missin'?
Tell me what?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
How's that?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Peter Joshua.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Are you in the book?
Charles is.
What are you doing here?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
What's going on?
You mean you and me?
I don't think I follow you.
We're here.
Be careful, Peter.
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
What'd he say?
I believe what he said.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
Ça alors! From Charles?
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
But what?
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Do you know him?
I've never seen him before.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
What's the matter, chérie?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
You do?
I never fucked Rod.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
I get the imports.
No.
You said that two weeks ago.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
What do you mean?
A little.
You are upset.
It was a she.
Are you sure?
Who is she Daddy?
What did you hear?
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
Did you warn her?
Your brother told us.
You're not?
Who's?
I'm sure you should have failed.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
You can't tell your parents.
Cut it out.
I do not.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Yeah. Who is she?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
What?
How could you?
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Hide your laptop here.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.


Where do you want this stuff?

Huh?
I need your help.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
All right.

What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
It happens to this piece of shit...
...-ed.
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.



Kiss my ass!
Well, then, that means it's call...
...waiting!
I think...
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
That's right.  Now,  move!
Oh, shit.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...Pete.  Come on.
 Okay.  That didn't work.
 Okay.  Okay. 
...you're dealin' with!
...man!
He's crazy!
Taking it down the hill.

Oh, shit!
Oh, no!
We were nationally  ranked.
Robert Del Rio?
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
Hey.   Mason.
A-And you  owe me...
Are you all right?

 Come on!

Okay. 
Okay, here we go.
...-ful?!
Here...
...they come!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Shoot me. 
Oh.

Hold this. 

You, Arlo.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
I think so too.
Yeah.
We're worried...
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
But...
You got a prob-...
...-lem too?
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
But you have no choice but to follow orders.

...I wish they would've let me say something...
All right.  After they put you away...
And let me guess.  You failed.
...happen if I drop this?
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
Radio the bikes.
Check the immediate area.
Dennis!
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...screwup?
Where's their protective...
...gear?
I beg your pardon?
I assume you have one.
Odd, then, that his car...
Where's Arlo?


 Two pots of coffee...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
There's something else too.
Uh, we both like to fish.
Rangers.
Kabula's out.
Great.  All right...
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
...try this one out some-...
...is a perfect hunter.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
Tie a fly...
...-son.
Forty-seven.
...tunnel!
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
...you answer mine.
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
...stole a truck under arrest.
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
...we're all gonna die in this...
The Army, sealin' us in.
Oh.
Do it now.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
Then these are all new owners?
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
None.
Too bad?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
Yes, his girlfriend.
Maybe.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Just find the girl.
Avocado groves?
What does this mean?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
She's just no good.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
Oh they don't?
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Off the alley.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
Well you own a lot of land.
Where did you get this material?
How are you, Lou?
Who?
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
What for?
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.
My husband's at the office.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
I'll stop by.
...Just a minute...
You left your keys in the ignition.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
No.
And Hollis knew about it?
I gave everybody the night off.
Working for the District Attorney.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
And I want to know where.
The Albacore Club.
You didn't tell me.
I am not!
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
Sure.
I want to see her.
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
...no...
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Where'd he go yesterday?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Mr. Gittes?
Do you know me?
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
What about the water?
When it comes.
Come again?
Then go home and forget about it.
But...
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
He did or he didn't?
How did they get it away from him?
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
So I can have these? 
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Will they really find work in Germany?
Yes. 
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
Father, I have sinned...
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
Who else did you see?
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
Sixty-two thousand -
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
That's Leland, isn't it?
I'm sure that's it. 
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
I intend to find out.
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
What's the matter with you?
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Yes -
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
Impossible!  Impossible!
Get Dr. Corey.
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
All right.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
I'll sign those papers -
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Maybe you could remember something that -
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
Yes, sir.
Who told you you could sit down here?
How did you meet him?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Unnhh!
Well, if it's already too late...
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
Jesus!
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Beats me.
Excuse me, but...
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
So where is he?
Can I use the bathroom?
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
What about Sing?
I'm just kidding.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
What time was this?
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
That's easy to say from over here.
Are you open?
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
So?
Shocking abuse of authority.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Did you tell Veronica?
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Oh, my God.
Great story, isn't it?
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
The milkmaids.
Why not?
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Design major.
Helluva game!
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
If you go, I go.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I'm going with you.
He made it, hunhh?
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
Holy shit. That girl?
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
You're kidding.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
What responsibility?
What time did you get to work today?
It's not like I'm miles away.
Helluva day.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
No, she's getting married.
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
Go open the video store.
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
I'm trying.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Hunhh? Nothing.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
What the hell was that for?
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
That's because I never had sex with him!
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Well...?
Lower your voice!
I'm going to class.
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
You open?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
What's this?
Scumbag. What are you doing?
What did he say?
Does he sing in English or Russian?
Really?
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
And... he told you all of this?
He didn't ask me to...
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
I copy.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
What usually eats a banana?
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
The money!
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
What the hell are you doing here?!
There wasn't time for anything else.
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
How're ya feeling?
She's tough.
We spent a night there one night...
And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
Why are you yelling?
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Yeah?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
What's he doing?
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Yeah...
You're looking at him.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Where's the third one, Travers?
Don't give him anything.
What about it?
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Richard Travers.
What did you do that for?
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Great, sir. Great.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
Who are they, sir?
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
So this is the young man?
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Good.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
Fine, fine.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
No, sir.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Are you referring to the background score?
You've heard Beethoven before?
How are you feeling today?
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Yes.
I was quite enjoying that.
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
You have, my son.
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Mothballs, sir.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Yeah... Pete the English.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Sixth is faster.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Big case?
Just had one.
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
I'm...fine.  Fine.
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Oh, my, yes.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
I'm sorry.
What?
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Very generous.
So?
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
Hi, Ma.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
You hassling my driver again?
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
Yeah?  So?
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
It's home.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
With what?
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
What?
Tonight it is.
Who's that?
I need the job.
What?
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
Jazz.  Music.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
What you mean, no?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Show up for <u>what?</u>
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
It's not bullshit.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
I don't know.
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
As in...? 
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
You're going too fast.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Not for years.
Motive?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
People do have heart attacks.
For what?
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Nothing is easy.
That's it?
Who?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
He's why you punish yourself.
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
We're going to Queens?
Connecticut.
They'll trace it.
Blue moon...
Blue moon...
How did you know?
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Excuse me?
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
I'm still listening.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Ah, your psychotic is here.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
Which way did he go?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
What?  Why?
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
What?
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
And a hundred mile airspace.
That's my scientist.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
Not if you think like a Vegan.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
What's that?
The systems integration site.
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
But the work --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
I'm -- I'm fine.
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
Champagne please.
Yes.  Very much.
I read your book.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
What'd you think?
Ellie, what is it?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
Please --
Hi.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Meaning...
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
Here, Mom.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
I don't know, Boss.
Please! Please!
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
What happened? How far did you get?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
You already made the delivery?
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
Who is this?
Would you want to work with us on this?
For months... last October.
How do you know that?
How did you know they were stockings?
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
You're afraid of him.
What's that siren?
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
Yes.
Open the door.  Please.
Who came in after you?
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
You came in there with this attitude...
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
Look at her legs.
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
What!? They brought the car here?
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
Have you seen it?
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
You should have gone to the funeral.
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
Yes.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
What does he want from you?
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
Yeah, everything's under control.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
But what am I going to do?
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Oh no.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Mom, please.
Don't be fresh.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
Letty.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
I answered these questions last night.
Yes?   Go right ahead.
By color.
No.
A daisy for the lady.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
Michael, I...
So there were no problems?
Just checking.
I love your apartment.
Hey.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
Why'd you tell?
I guess we need to talk.
Well then why'd it happen?
What are we going to do?
I love you so much.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
Getting back.
I think I've heard this speech before.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Zero.   That's all I know.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
You've already robbed the safe?
Where's your brother?
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
Half the tapes.
What kind of business?
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Why not just steal another one?
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Hopefully no one.
Turn on the flashlight.
Good idea.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Anybody hungry?
What?
You haven't answered my question.
Okay, we're square now, right?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
What room number?
I was told to take what we have and go.
What about transportation?
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
This kind.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
I'll drive.
Going somewhere?
It's good.
Give it to me, Sami.
What happened?
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Uh huh.
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
The money isn't here.
You're not helping.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
Algeria.
What does arresting us get them?
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
Who's gonna see it there?
Frankie, I --
Then leave her to me.
Shut up!
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
This spells trouble.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
How so?
You're doing calligraphy?
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
No, really?
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Lo?
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
I will.
It has.  How's business?
Good.  And how are you?
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
No, not yet...
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
They're gone.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
This is a delicate matter.
What do you have in mind?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
No onions though, okay?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
They couldn't do anything for me.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
Mom --?
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
Mom tried to cook.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
Do you know what you destroyed?
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
Shut up.
I'm Kathryn.
Did you know Sebastian well?
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
I have his journal.
On my mother's life.
So what year are you going into?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
Thank you.
Shut up.
You're naked.
That's repulsive.
Need a lift?
How are you today?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
No, not at all.
Need any company?
Yes it does.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
That's not fair.
You really want to know?
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
I'll see you tomorrow.
What are the boys like?
That's great.
It was nothing.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Something awful happened last night.
I don't know.
If that's what you call it.
Well did you like it?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Just taking your photo.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Want a blow job?
I know.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Whoa!
She bought it.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
I see your point... though why should I care?
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Care to make a wager on that?
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
Loser.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
Shut up.
So? How'd it go last night?
It was... Fantastic.
Excuse me?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
I thought we should celebrate.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Get off me!
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Not at all. What's wrong?
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
I can't thank you enough.
Let me get that for you.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
Yes, darling.
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
I got my wish anyway.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Where'd you get this, darling?
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I'm never unfair.
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
But there's no one here, darling.
But why?
A lady threw it to me.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
It got hit.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Who is she?
Mommy read it to ne.
Mother! You called me by name!
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
How have you been feeling?
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
How'd it go with the cop?
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
Okay. I guess so.
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
Why not? There's been a murder.
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
Guess she never found true love.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
I know.
I do development for TV movies.
I really gotta pee.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
You look different. I mean you look good.
Look what you did!
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
Where'd you get the bike?
On your desk.
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
Did you change your hair?
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
When's the last time you saw him?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
No, why?
Is it that funny?
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
They do? Oh no...
Go away. I might hurt you.
Peter I love you too but...
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
No, I have a cat.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
You're some catch Lloyd.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
I told you she was innocent.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
What makes her think that?
And that was 28 days ago today.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Sell maps?
Not really...
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
They don't speak English...
I don't know what you're talking about.
In there.
What is this place?
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Iím your new assistant.
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
Where do you think this goes?
Can't let you in...  sorry.
Donít kill me!
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
What does she say?  The woman.
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
Horrible...
I'm nothing then.
First Lady...
What the hell is this?
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Like how?
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Your government needs your help.
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
Oh... Yeah.
Anybody would have done it.
How were you gonna get home?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
Yes.
I can't.
You really believe that?
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
I missed...
We're all set,  sir.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
Gasparilla?
What is it if it ain't a curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
What'dya get?
Sounds boring to me.
It will?  How do you figure?
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
All right.  I'll try anything once.
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Yes sir.
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
This is stupid.
What are you doing?!
Sort of.
Hello?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox, I don't believe this!
Chris!
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Then come with me.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
I have to go home. Chet might call.
Yes sir.
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
LOUDER!
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Yeah.
You really think I should forget her?
Father!
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
I... I just don't want to come.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
What is that supposed to mean?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
From you?
Todd, what's the matter?
This play?
I'll come to the performance.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Visit from my father.
How do we get out of here?
What the hell are you talking about?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
And no questions asked.
The thieves.
Noooo!
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
It's not them...it's it...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
You don't take orders very well, do you?
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
A little to the left...
She's gone...
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
I know, but...
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
Everybody love Linda.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Oh. Fine.
Naw.
Hey, guys...
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
I want to go home, Merle.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Huh?
Fucking A.
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
Forget Sal.
What do you mean?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
We what?
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
Here, here! This is it!
That's it. No. No way.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Don't worry what it says in the book.
Listen, Nick --
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
Yeah!
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Yeah?
Kimberly!
I'm not on the force anymore.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Sir---
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
You're not pregnant, are you?
...Have you been drinking?
You okay?
No.  I want to be with you.
Hi.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
I'll take it.
You're lying.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
What do you want?
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
-- of what happens after we die!
Where did it come from?
Yes, why shouldn't it?
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
But -- I was just lucky.
Jabez -- help!
Who is it?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Jabez!
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
But I'm glad to be home again --
Worried!
I'll never get my washing done.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Isn't that your own fault?
Jabez!
You know that, son.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Come in, Sheriff.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
You aren't angry with me?
It is.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Just someone from New Hampshire!
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
You mean -- a jury trial?
You can talk to me ...
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
One of yours?
No, sir.
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
Ellis, what have you told them?
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
Bad for your health anyway.
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
'Roy'.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
I still feel like shit.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
This is --
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
Heidi, I'm dying.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
No.  Look, we're kind of....
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
What are you talking about?
Why you going to Algeria?
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
What?
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
It's my only chance!
Who's this?
They're okay.
I got Sal.
You frisk me.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Okay, give us the women.
Come on.  I want you to see something.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Yeah?
Hey... let him out!
Okay, is the vault open?
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
What?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
I'm sorry.
What now, Sonny?
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
Pure?
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Yeah ...
I never been up in a plane before.
They're trying to come through the door!
What?
Okay, Sonny.
There it is, Sal.  Sal?
Bullshit!
I can't allow that, Sonny...
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Oh my God, mother!
No!
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
You could give up.
This is Bishop.
Morning.
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
So what?
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
Yes.

And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
It's been about a year.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
That's it?
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
Stop tripping.
What are you so worked up about?
Nice!
Jade, you're late.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
It's a fucking shame.
What?
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Yeah, do you know 'em?
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
OK.  OK.
Shit!  I forgot.
What else?
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
You deaf or what?
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
That's what you think?
I was going to buy a slice.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
Some are OK.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Oh my god, are you alright?
I'm fine.
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
The name's Walter.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
I haven't seen you around here before.
I go to school where I live.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
Who's Principal Collins?
Oh, is this your special place?
The second R is silent.
Whoa. What was that?
You're not my real dad.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
No.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Nice jugs.
You're it.
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
Nope. I was right.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
You can't marry my mom.
You're always your harshest critic.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
Do you want me to pet your head?
HARRY!
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
I don't know what you're talking about.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
You're just jealous.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Okay.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
I am strong!
Oh, just like the President.
The evidence of what?
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
My Lord!
What does Leto say, Piter?
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
Yes...
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
No.
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
Did they try and fail?
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
No.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Are you sure this is okay?
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
I never said I could ad-lib...
Eddie, you screwed up.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
Don't let me slow you down.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
What happened?!
Really?  I don't feel so great.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
Rolling.
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
Edward Wood, Sir.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
What other sixty-thousand?
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
Would that work?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
Oh.  Congratulations.
I am.  How's your father?
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
What was that?
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Yes?
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
You're sure this is gonna work?
Yes!
You're <u>sure</u>???
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
Why... yes.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
What if--you're vomiting?
Come on...
Who?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
How you doing, Ed?
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
They tore her dress! ...
Yeah?!
Ed --
Where are you going?
You know who we are?
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Right.
Are the TV people with you?
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
He says --
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
St. Joseph's.
What happened?
It was horrible. He called me up.
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Ma...
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
What does this mean?
How much less?
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Are you sure about this?
Cream rinse?
Can't we just --
What are you doing?
I wish my stepfather was here.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Everybody hates me!
Okay.
Kinda'.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Yeah?!
Ray --
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Who is it?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
I know.
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
No -- keep it.
What...
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Mm.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Tracy.
Hey, that's super
Looks good to me.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
Why are you lecturing me?
What's this?
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
What do you mean?
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
How's the left these days?
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Yeah.
When they deserve it.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
I want to know about Exley.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
Yeah, I hate them.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
What are you talking about?
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
That's him.  That's him.
What's through here?
Where are we going?
One in six.  Where's the girl?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Dudley's guys.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
What about him?
Bud...
No.
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
More or less.
Say what and so what.
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
I don't own no shotguns.
No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
You're the key witness?
What about you?
So what's the point?
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
She is Lana Turner.
What?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Decorated?
How about White?
Why not?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
Right now, before I back down.
On what evidence?
Do you have any proof?
My daughter was a virgin!
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Something good?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
It'll be our secret.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
DePinto's dead.
Clear as day.
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
Why?
Wait.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
It's a SAT-tracker.
I don't know what that means.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
I don't know what that--
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
And you won't. Now move--
I didn't use my name.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Gimme that.
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
What if--
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
What if <u>what</u>?
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Oh my God.
Is it okay?
Can you help me?
What size?
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
Anything at all?
No, sir.
Just for the criminals.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
I know, but listen--
Just reporters.
Good.
What is it?
It's really over?
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
You don't know who the fuck--
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
It tastes like fish.
DePinto?
Other than me.
Why would I--
Good. You're just what I need right now.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
You're wrong.
We'd rather not--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Your shoe.
Gentlemen--
Who would do that?
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
Mr. Dean--
Sure, go ahead.
In your dreams.
Where's mom?
Who won the fight?
It's okay to use the phone.
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
No.
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Into what?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Why would they--
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
Tell me about it.
How can I reach you?
Yes sir.
What about the tapes?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
He had help.
We don't know.
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
No.
Excuse me?
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
What do you mean, poetry?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
He said - be careful.
Pardon?
What's this?
I'd like you to have them.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Do they know them?
You sew very badly.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
Arabic?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
It's so cold.
Don't leave me!
Tell me about your garden.
A broken car?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Which we've overflown twice.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
I don't know.
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
She can take you as far as Florence.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Are you planning to be the exception?
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
Irving Berlin.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
I see.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Candaules
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
How?  How can you see anything?
I can see my wife in that view.
Your friend?
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
For my hair?
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
What are you up to?
Will you come with me?
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
You've got a mustache.
Go away.
Then you were married?
The windows don't open.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
Meaning--
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
We're getting close.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
I have a question...
Mr. MacDougal.
I don't want to waste your time.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
I've got something...
I didn't expect you to be so...
Do you mind?
No. Why would I be?
And I thought we were getting on so well.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
We're going to die, aren't we...
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
I trust it's your size.
It's a party.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
Oh my god, I thought--
What about the rules?
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
You can't be serious.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
No way.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
He looks familiar.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Remind me why.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
You're giving them to me?
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Which one?
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
For what?
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
Out to lunch with the girls.
You're a girl.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
No shit.
Hey.  I like working with you.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
What kind of truck?
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
She insulted me!
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
You see your office?
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...
When'd they file the demur?
How many counts?
Corey.
Right.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
I don't know.
PG& -- Are you sure?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
Think you could learn?
There's something else, too.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Next week.
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
Soon, Lord Vader.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
That's right.
What is it?
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Yes, you do.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Are you crazy!
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
What are you staring at?
No thanks.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
Why not me?
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
They're my friends.
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
The Hoth System?
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
Go easy, Stevie.
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Ooww!
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
Shut up, Plissken.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Lock fuel rods.
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Location.
I said pull over.
Is that what I think it is?
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
So be it, to the death.
What?!
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Yes.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
Who does it serve?
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
No.
Who?!
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
Dinner at the White House.
What didn't he tell you?
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
It's serious?
Groceries maybe? A package?
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
But it's clean?
No. No rats.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
How are you today?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Convulsion?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
We still think the temporal lobe...
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Please go away.
Where?
Sure did.
On what?
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
No.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
When can I have one?
Hey, where'd this come from?
Wait a minute you need two.
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Do you not like him like daddy?
How do you know?
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Honey this is Father Dyer.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Oh, Christ.
What's playing.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
Ego te abslovo.
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
Oh really, when?
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Sick priest, is that it?
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Who?
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
...Be gone!!
Yes?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Who is it?
I don't know.
It's our goddamn car!
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Beasley.
What's wrong with them?
They're falling out.
No bones?
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Frank.
I hate your kids, Frank.
You're their uncle.
Cindy.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Yeah?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
What's the matter?
I'll drop the eighths.
Get out of here!
Hey, Frank.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Okay.
Yeah.
All night?
Why would I mind?
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Christ, can't you hear it?
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
Celebrating.  Join me?
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
What do you mean?
No.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
What?
Stay off it.
I didn't hear you come in.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
So what'd you think?
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
So she's got a few sniffles.
This is show business?
How should I take it?
We ran long.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
Nine?
Right.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Huh?
What're you talking about?  They love it.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Whatcha doin' over there?
Don't worry about it.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
In and out.
What's that supposed to mean?
Coffee?
You can always get another girl.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
I guess it's getting serious.
Looks old.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
Or reactivated the first one.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
You killed them?
Stay away from my family!
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Oh, that Karl.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
Hello?
Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
And I know people.
What about me?
They did a pretty good job.
On a case by case basis...
I think I could figure it out.
Im having kind of a bad day.
I dont think so.
She said that?
So could you write down her exact address?
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itll be returned!
Yes you do...
You just said everyone needs something.
You cant do this. You cant keep coming in and out of peoples lives, messing things up...
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
Something like that.
Are we...?
It would help me if we were.
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
What kind of man does that!?
Jack...dont even start...
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
Jack...
Uh...that babys crying...
Hey!  I was watching that!
Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?
Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
How can you do that?
Do what?
Well...Annie for one.
Our life in a nutshell...
Cmon.
Jack.
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
And now...?
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
Youre so...beautiful...
I could stay here forever...
This place is a perk, Kate.
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
Youre not married, are you?
Mrs. Peterson.
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
For one thing, you like expensive things.
For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...
Can I help you?
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
He's made a few changes.
The shields on the station should protect us.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
Oh, he did.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
You're really cramping my style here.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
Then what is it?
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
Are you kidding?
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Oh, I think you already have.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
Benes... What the devil happened?
How bad off is he?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
Trip? Where to?
Yes, Alan.
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
What is it?  Anything wrong?
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
A long time, with one man.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Look at that...they're changing color...
Shouldn't you answer that?
You must carry spare parts --
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Yes...
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
You said there was a quick way out!
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
A what?
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Looks like somebody declared war.
Sort of.
Come on -- it's no use!
Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
How's it look?
I'll never find my way through that.
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
I don't know. Few munce.
I did.
One of us pays the other for half.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
...Blood has been shed.
We need more -
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Both of these.
Mr. Mohra?
Yah.
I unnerstand.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Just a general way.
Uh-huh.
Yah.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Yah, that can happen.
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Yah.
Yah, okay.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
I know it's a lot.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Yah?
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
No, I didn't...
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
Uh-huh.
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
What'd he say?
And this guy is...
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
Uh-huh.
Oh, my.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
That wouldn't interest you.
There's no one else here.
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
Oh.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Yes?
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
It means it was homemade.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
You need to lighten up.
I'm in pain.
What?
And I saw you practicing this...
I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Like testicular cancer?
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
Chloe's dead.
That... sawing and hammering.
Say my name!  What's my name!?
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Who did this to you?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Is this a test, sir?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
I don't... think so.
Thank you.
They're called "cigarette burns."
A nice, big cock.
I don't know about this.
Where's your car?
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Doesn't matter.
Any historical figure.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
I want to hear the truth.
What?
What are you talking about?
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
What about Marla?
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
I quit.
I think this is about where we came in.
Paraffin.
What?
Damn it!  God-damn it...
NO...
What are you doing?
What?
Yes, it is.
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
What list?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
I'm not sure I understand.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
What's going on here?
I tried calling last night but your father --
This is cheery.
Stop it, don't move him!
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
Can I ask you a question?
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
4:25.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
I don't.
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Ever do this from a jet?
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
American?
That guy's not going to make it.
You better take off.
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
Huntington Beach, California.
You think you are... .
Look, Co...
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Why me?
Not yet.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
Who're you?
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
Am I out of here?
This your stuff?
Let's do it.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
No really..I can't.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
I... I was just leaving.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
How much?
Lydia.  Lydia what?
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
The Little...
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
I'm not married.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
But I gave it to you!
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
In a bar called Hellfire.
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
I never say anything I have to.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
Divorced.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
You're not going to play it again.
You can sing the song.
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
You like it?
What?
Is what you?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Who?
Hey, mack!
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
Now don't...
Sorry.
Tita, I've got to go...
What questions?
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
Nothing.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
If you're free.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
Is that funny?
I didn't have any.
No inner feeling.
I'm fine.
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I have to talk to you.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
Robert, do you mind?
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
Victor.
What are you doin' here?
Of course.
A play-ya.
Just chill.
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
The one with the phat ass?
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
I think he's 18 or 17.
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
No.
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
Sonofabitch.
Fletch!
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
My God, you're serious.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Mrs. Smith.
Oh, he was dying for years.
So what do you figure?
Affirmative.
Where am I?
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
Check.
Then he has.
Where are you going?
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Yeah. Maybe.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Do you have a passport?
They serve dinner on the flight?
You sure got the hard part.
Will you kill me?
Yo!
Did you hear something?
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
You ordered it here?
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
I saved his life during the war.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
What's wrong, Gail?
What is this....
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
One.
Where is she?
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
Uh, almost.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
How gray?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
Not really.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Who's your decorator?
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
So many assholes, so few bullets.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
You wish.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Hello, Ford...
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Hey, they blew me.
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Zuzu, wake up...
Ford, you were right!
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
I tried to help you...!
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Fine!
How's it going?
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Jazz, we're talking here.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
It doesn't have to be like this?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
I'm still the king!
You're that guy, the private eye.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
So...
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Who knows?
Where do you want it?
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
Sal --
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Allo... Salvatore...
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
He is not wrong.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
You want the red or the white?
What about Sal?
Where'd you get this fag shit?
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
I love you, Bud.
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Where are you transmitting from?
What?
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
You call your son Little Chief?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Dad...?
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
It's really you, isn't it?
I think I'm losing you.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Something happened, something...
What?  What is it?
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
Whatta you mean...
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Whatta we do now?
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
It's not your fault, Dad.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
John, you there?
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
Uh, huh.
Got a minute?
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Who brought up this bright idea?
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
Breakfast?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Do you want a beer or not?
Will you come with me?
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
You promised you'd never ask me.
Hi.
My whole world.
Got any good ideas?
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Whaddya mean?
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Lake Forest Green?
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Why?
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
He didn't say anything?
Will you listen, dammit!
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
I've seen it.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Look --
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Hello...
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
Lock this asshole up.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
Why didn't you tell me?
Randy, c'mon!
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
A major prick.
What are you going to do?
What's wrong?
What are you doing in here?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
What did you do with Rennie??
You're telling a lie.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
So, are you having fun yet?
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
When did this start?
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
I opened thousands of brains.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
Very dangerous.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
I think we Nought to wait.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
This could be it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Our Peter?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
The Red Sox
This is how we've managed to last.
Because we're completely mismatched.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
That's completely crazy.
Is it?
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
She is kicking you out.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
It's your best play, Nicky.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
How prominent?
Who the hell cares?
That's always been my problem.
Where the hell are you?
What do you want?
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
How come you got the kid with you?
You see what you're doing, don't you?
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Why?
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
Endearing.
Say it again.
He wears a disguise.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
He's a very sweet man.
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Are you sure?
Everyone takes his turn.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
What do you want?
You will respect the law.
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
It's over.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
No?  What's keeping you?
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
What a relief.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Twelve have a mission within the week.
Good to see you're feeling better.
What's wrong with it?
You had to be a right-hander.
Let's get out of here.
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
Call German.
Come on--we're taking off.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
Is that all?
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
How long?
Thank you.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Why not?
No bother.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
We were just looking.
Does it have a name?
What exactly is wrong?
Why are we leaving?
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
The doctor will give you something.
The name?  For the certificate.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
We'll try again.
Half a million.
You go out much?
It's all right.
I'll be okay.
How was it?
I didn't. I just waited.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
They checked in.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
He must have.
When are you going to learn?
Where are you going?
Can we make it?
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
So what?
How long before this car's hot?
What now?
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Oh my God.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Suit yourself.
Wire pull over?
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
Aren't we going a little hard?
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
Can he trust you?
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
I know.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
I want to talk to you later.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
Sid Fletcher.
We went about together.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
I don't know.
Shouldn't think so.
Yeah.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
It just would. He was always the same.
Right.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
No. Really, I am.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
Pension him off.
Did you sleep well?
Are you tired?
And that'll make me feel better?
No, I didn't know that.
Still got a sense of humour?
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
All right. Two hundred.
That's right.
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
They came in and they, you know...
They did.
And now...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
You get a bad month, all of a...
All of, they got you on this "board..."
Eh...?
For some sales pro...
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
What hard part?
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
They...
You haven't talked to him.
Did you?
Did you talk to Graff?
Me?
I...
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Yes.  I'm sure.
...and rob the place...
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
I do?
They stole...
What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
...what am I going to do all month...
The cops?
Where were you?
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Was I?
Thieves.
Will you excuse us please?
No.
I want to work today, that's why I came...
Go to lunch, George.
Excuse me, fella.
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
What two?
...then...
Not lately it isn't.
...you talk to Murray...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Murray said...
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Not lately you can't...
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Alright.
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
Can't do it.
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
Why I don't...
What are you talking about?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
Was it?
Abso...
I've got the check...
Because I don't like you.
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
Just now.
...yes...
Home cooking...
Oh!  For the magazine...
To change our minds.
Yest...
And when was that check cashed?
I told you.
You tell me again.
This.
She told me not to talk to you.
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
I'm going home.
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
Are you alright?
Did you like your party?
Just a few days.
Will you take me?
I can't.
What position did you occupy?
We have no money for a rug.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
Not for strangers; for my country.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
What's that?
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
What do you want me to do?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
We have time.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
Where's my brother?
Go on, tell me.
Mike, at three and a half...
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
That plane goes to Miami...
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
What the hell are you talking about?
This committee owes an apology!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
Nothing is more important.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
So?
Let him gamble.
That is a complete falsehood.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
I know.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Trust me; do as I ask.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
We got friends in the commission.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
Yes.
I accept your generosity...
What's that mean?
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
It still hurt.  A lot.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
I'm not married.
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Of course.  I am married still.
What have you done with him?
But I didn't do this!
Good morning.
These are your paintings?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
All right, I guess.
Did you now?
Did you kill anyone?
So we understand each other?
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
You were a soldier?
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
You're the one who started it.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
Let's get out of this funk hole
A very lucky thing indeed.
What happened?
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
So it is going to happen after all.
What won't do?
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
What was that?
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Jimmy.  How are you?
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
I don't mind.
You're serious.
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
They gave you only four days?
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
What do you mean -- ?
How's that?
You'll leave -- ?
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
Double-meaning intended --
When'd you get to town, Raines?
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
There's no one left ...
How are we supposed to--
Any word, Kip -- ?
oh.
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
What time of year?
I know...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Any more ...
Yeah ...
You all right -- ?
This has nothing to do with any of that --
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Yeah -
I can handle it --
You okay -- ?
I know ...
How's it going?
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
On account of Mitch?
What the hell are you doing -- ?
She's trouble --
Ready -- ?
The hard part ...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
What happened to Sway?
What about me?
Not --
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
Nods again.
What're you doing? What about the car?
My bag. My bag.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I'm just having my last few drinks.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
Paulie was just talking about him.
There are cops all over the place.
You want the melon?
Yeah.
I want to talk to Jimmy.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
Yeah, yeah.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
No, no. It's okay.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
I don't want them left back.
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
All right, then.
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
How's the woman?
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
How you doin'?
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
Shut up.
What's up guys?
What'd you say about me?
I'm not sure--
What class did you say that was?
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
That's one aspect of what we do.
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
What're you doing?
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
Okay. How?
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
I don't know what it's called.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
I can come back.
Hey, how you doin'?
Thank you.
Tom.
You're here quite a bit, then.
I live right around the corner.
I think so.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
Now wait a minute--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
Hold on!
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Oh, that's nice--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
--I don't have any anger at you--
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
Do you know when you'll be back?
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
About thirty million to one.
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
You've never been out of Boston.
Why not?
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
Gerry says the meeting went well.
Don't give me you line of shit.
I didn't ask for this.
I been there. I played my hand.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
Oh, I know.
It's not...
Five minutes.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
How many?
Your house must have been a zoo.
Promise?
No.
Clearly.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
Yeah, I'm sure.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
At least you have a mother.
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
You doin' the hirin'?
Twenty days work, oh boy!
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Joad.
How many men?
Four.
Two.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
*You* find out, I can't.
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
Yeah. On my way home now.
Why, you're the preacher!
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
What's the matter?
Casy! What you doin' here?
Thought you was in jail.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Yeah.
You ain't got to get sore.
You been acrost?
California.
Got any plants?
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.
Anybody ask anything?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Sometimes they do.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
What is it?
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
Tommy?
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
Well?
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
But what about this?
--Stop it--
--No.
Wonderful.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
It's me. Martin Blank.
I want to be an actor.
Yes.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Not much else.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
You met people.
Hello...?
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
You're fucking psycho.
...Let me get my coat.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Shoulda brought my gun.
Which would you rather...?
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
He was trying to kill you, right!
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
I was leaving.
You kill people. 
How do you know?
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
Well?
I don't think so.
It was the PLO.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
And not show it to me. Ever again.
They're not happy, sir.
They were very upset.
I have scruples. Next.
It's fine.
I spoke to your father the other day.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Ten years. What happened!?
I'm a professional killer.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
The answer's no.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Feel good?
Why didn't it work out?
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Oh. You didn't tell me.
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
He's still sitting in that damn field.
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
How's everything?
Okay.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
What was I saying?
What if she doesn't want to go?
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Huh-huh. You?
About what?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
You're allergic to hay.
Was the trip okay?
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Frank's a good man.
What?
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
Jude, you okay?
You want to watch some television?
You just showing off for her!
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Secret Service!
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Let's keep her.
Shh!
Hold on a second!
Damn!
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Go fix the phones.
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Did you talk to him?
Dead?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Shit! Come on!
Never heard of you. Done anything?
What's this one eat?
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
If I win, you become my slave.
And if I win?
What?
You what?
Why did he come to you?
I'll make it up to you!
Alright, so what have we got?
Oh, wow, she's great.
You would have looked better.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Uhhhmm...
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
We caught 'em.
Good.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
What? whatwhatwhat?
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Excuse me?
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Send a Flu-shot.
Don't get angry.
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
Brady! Come with us.
Go!
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
Mom, please
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Found it.
Now where are you going?
Hi.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Rachel!
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Where are you going?
What are we doing?
These kids aren't likely to forget.
Sort of.
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
What time?
Saving the treats for Bob?
I have a place for that.
Look where?
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Wait a minute here...
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
We're all alone, aren't we?
I gotta go.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
What do we do?
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Exactly what do you need?
TOTALLY!
Is Annie around?
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Well, she's totally not here.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
Not any more.
Why are they under there?
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Yes.
There's nothing else I can do.
It means... I see.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
It's French, though.  It really is.
Well, I live downtown.
And you, you-you're going?
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Hmm?
We're actresses.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Uh-huh.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
When did you first notice this?
Ed Smythe, yes.
...with the affiliates.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
No, I don't think so.
Well, thanks a lot.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Oh, yeah.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
Is something wrong?
Lee...
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
No!
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
...or films you must see or... 
I'm saying it now!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Hello?
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Oh, great.
Oh, yeah?
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Oh, now-- 
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Hi!  Hi!
He's fine.
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
He's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
Ouch!
Well, how about this?
Oooo.
Oh?
Yeah, can you believe it?
You know.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
Oh, gosh.
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Good.
Hey, what's the matter?
At least I'm open to new concepts!
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
Good.  How are you?
So how are you?
No, I am.  I am.
Nobody ever said it.
Oh, I'm fine.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Right.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Oh, who cares?
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Hi.  How you doin'?
Okay.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
And?
It wasn't my day.
Or, perhaps...
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
You want me to be?
...they did it for a lark.
I'm not.
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.
I know her by the Back.
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
What else did I miss...?
Impossible.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Somewhere in Italy.
You give me whatever I want...?
I won't take much of his time.
...young boys, still...?
...and then, he'll be coming down.
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
I am all attention.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
Waal...
My husband brought it to me from America.
A wonderful country...
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy. 
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
How could you know?
...Franklin.
We got KittyKat...
You were given backup....
...may be the heat....
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
...might I make a suggestion...?
What's that, Baby?
Look what they put her on...
You should get Married.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Then we cannot go.
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Or clear your windshield with it.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
...I feel that...
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Then tell me.
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
You want some <u>advice</u>.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
I hope so...
Mine!

Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
God, you're beautiful.

I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
What are you doing here?!
I don't know. Should you?
Like a suicide thing?
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
Your son's dead and you love him.
You're still not listening! I'm not..
This knife is filthy.
You know what I want, babe?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
You two....
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
playfully shoves his hand away.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
Hello!
I just want to be on my own for a while.
sighs.
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
That's coming along well!
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
Poor Father . . .
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Sure plenty of times.
Yeah, how's that?
Really? Do tell.
What's the occasion?
So you're just packing it up just like that?
You could say that.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Oh my God. It's coming out.
What?
Really, why's that?
What evidence?
Thanks.
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
What's under that sheet...?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
Dreams?
Wait... what the hell is this...
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
We're all assholes, Bernie?
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
He waited for you three hours!
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
I... I know that, John...
Gale...
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
Unprofessional.
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
So where are all your toys?
Are you being helped, sir?
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
Well, can I make an appointment?
About what?
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Thank God.
Honey --
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
We're going to think about it.
How were we -- were we cool?
No.
All new houses have noises.
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Would you?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Sing.
I hear you.
As friends -- always as friends.
That doesn't matter.
It will be a good harvest this year.
How comes it your are not afraid?
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Different places.
The past?
Aye.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Why do you stare at me like that?
I don't have any answers for you.
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
So?
What's that next to him?
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
Why did you wait?
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
Why?
My dreams died long ago.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
I can take care of myself.
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
I guess so.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
The best.
You think we should take that chance?
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Jesus.  What is this?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
I'm here.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
The cops are comin'!
You got something to say?
I don't know.
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
That big asshole nailed my windows.
What?
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Go.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Sounds like you know the job.
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Go, Mickey.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
How about you and your sister?
Where are you right now?
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
He has lots of disks.
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
Can you get into the office?
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Did you find the disks?
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
I guess we each have something the other wants.
What do you mean by that?
Paul!
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Who are you?
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
Will you protect us.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. What do you think would have happened? No different.
Well rewarded Those were his words.
I will see what I can do.
Where are my supplies?
We must go to the Diplomat.
What do you mean, General?
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
You think they will believe you?
You will tell them the truth.
Business is good at the hotel?
Very good.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
I would never do that.
Call, sir?
Excuse me.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Thomas wants advice?
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
I sent them home. Go and call them.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
What about us?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
Can I have your name again?
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
You have taken business class?
What are you doing?
How much beer?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
What is this about no water?
Where?
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
It's complicated. But don't worry --
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Looks like we're it.
More the merrier.
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
Oh. Jesus.
What?
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
And we get this money when?
I don't think so...
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
I was upstairs with Eddie --
-- that's the fact, bud --
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
Don't think it's even an issue.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Asking the wrong person again.
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
No...
Please! Something! Oh-God!
What?
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
Sorry.
Well, I don't.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
And you think it's in there?
Blackburn's dead.
Sara...?
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Can you talk to her?
Help me!  Please!!!
Why?
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
But do you agree with me?
What are you talking about?
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Are you all right?
You're bleeding.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Maura.
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
This isn't happening...
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
What are you getting at!
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
What?
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
I'm trying to quit.
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
How have you ... ?
And he still sits there?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
Thank you.
Wow.  Thank you.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Yeah right.  Look ...
The security's actually not that severe.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
What the hell....
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Hit me with your best shot.
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
Wha--
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Where did you get this?
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Good job, not pretty, but good.
No, let me!
We're here to say, your government was right.
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
Ol' satchel-butt...
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Hungry, anyway.
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
I'm sure I --
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Sid found me the icepack.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
For Pete's sake, Norville!
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Now, Aim --
As a three-dollar bill.
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Watch it, Archer --
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Well, I --
...It is?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
No, sir.
But --
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
She finds him.
...Her mother needs an operation...
...adenoids.
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
Where?
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
Mrs. Rand...
Does she suffer?
She can never be cured?
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
The West Indies?
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
It is not beautiful.
Why was the maid crying?
I am not a frightened girl.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
I wanted to help you.
I told you.
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
To the asylum?
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
So maybe you'll come too?
You want to go?
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Hi dad.
All right.
Classes?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Fascist!
Nah.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
-- What advice? You never --
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
What?
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Yeah. You?
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
Mom. Are you ok?
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
That's right.
Reverend Edwards.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Am I right or am I right?
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
Awesome sleet and rain.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
You going to tell dad?
Yeah.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
I do.
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
I don't know.
Huh?
You're parents at that party?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Can I come?
Is this Charles?
Well, you can...
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
Good.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
You did your homework, Officer.
We already did.
Do it again.
What about your shoulder?
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
Forget your pager?
No.
What do you want to talk about?
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
You don't know.
I don't know.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Surely you know the one who made you...
Then blame the one who made her...
That's what the one who made me said.
Yes... My God...
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
You were their leader. They trusted you.
I'm not your daughter.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Claudia! You did that?
Or her, or her - or any of them?
You know her?
Yes...
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
You really want to be with them?
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Take him.
It can't be...
I can't.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
Unless I make her one of us...
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
It's just a room...
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
He did it to make you stay with him!
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Lestat escaped the fire!
No... it can't end like that...
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
No...
Yes.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Listen to me. He's here.
There's nothing between Will and me.
The number's unlisted...
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
Karaoke -- perfect.
Yes.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Oh, god, it's you --
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Can't what?
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Hey --
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
To a great weekend --
Come on, it'll be fun.
Not anymore.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
Take this.
What is up with that weirdo?
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
Goodbye.
They were gore before I came here.
All the graves?
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
I have forgotten it, dear.
But one must love a father.
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
That your father and I 
What is her illness?
Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
Come - you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Daughter -- my daughter --
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
I can't.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
Who?
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Who is it?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
What's that?
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Hmmm . . .
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Well, no younger than I was.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
I know it's soon to talk about it.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
George.
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
It's important.
Hello.
Well, what do you know  wife.
Why didn't you call me?
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
I'd like to do that.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Uh-huh.
I'm not very good at this.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
You may kiss my hand.
In that place?
What'd you wish, George?
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
Have you made up your mind?
Didn't you tell her?
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Hi.
Oh, George, George!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
Sure you do -- you win either way.
No.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Loser sails home alone.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
What camera?
I know just where to go.
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
You said something about a camera.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
That's it.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Why?
Nothing.
No.
What?
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
Are you serious?
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Where the hell is Air One?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Some people.
That's you.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Help!  Help!
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
What about the others?
What is it?
I thought you were grounded.
Faster!  Faster!
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
Wave to my son.
We're ready for you.
Go on, you're tired.
Don't feel bad.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Thank you.
Well, not much longer to go.
Hope I make it through both.
My imagination isn't that good.
Honey, I gotta go.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
Up.
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Here.
Kathryn...
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
They said you'd be here.
No,  I'm not going through there.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Somebody better get down there!
How is he?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Me.
You don't have to prove anything.
Are you okay?
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Still sleeping.
Get ready to go.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
They still seem nervous.
He's missing.
Herpes?
Yes, it's great!
Gotta sneeze.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
How far away is filter number four?
It's not closing, Mike.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Sharks???
Took it this morning.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Something wrong?
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Can I make sandwiches...?
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
How come it's my responsibility?
No fair, I'm not armed.
Off....
I have work....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
You caught me....
Whatever happens next.....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
We'll be there....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
The fish.  Check it....
I like Grandma's cooking....
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
I almost forgot....
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
I'm just getting started....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
I didn't mean to start that....
It's late....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
Depends on where you want to go....
How can you just take the plane like this?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
You're not going to bet it all....
What?
There's nothing to be sorry about.
I have coffee in the thermos.
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
Yes I can....
I hope she's a good sailor....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
The females have eggs....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
When I got the grant.....
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
'A Moray eel....'
You don't like my voice...?
You told me what?
I'll do it, Jake.
It's my fault...I have to....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Oh, Jake... 
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
What?
What about that kid, Ross?
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
I haven't got it.
Then give me that Zippo.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
What is that?
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
No .. But we have a theory ..
Bullshit.
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
Do you pray?
Have you known her long?
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
What does that mean?
So tonight she confesses?
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
Shut up, King Jay ..
Don't annoy me, Travis.
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
Now.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Can I help?
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
I'm relieved you said that.
Same to you.
Sure you're okay to drive this?
I don't know --
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
What about medical?
Wait. Where is he?
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Not right now, Jerry.
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
At last I find you.
Call me tomorrow.
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
You're telling me to dance.
I'll get you some quick work --
No, I don't know.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm asking you a question --
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
What --
Pardon me?
You'll lose.
-- and I'll get 'em.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Funny.
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
He says it's a bad idea!
We can't just...
What did you say?
That's him. Thats Eric!
Eric! Are you here?
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
That's hard to believe.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
Amanda!
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
What are you talking about?
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
What is?
It's... behind... us.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
There' no reason for name calling.
?!
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
You shouldn't use my name.
What?  No menthol?
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
They are?  I'll be damned.
Pretty sure.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
We were right!
Not just every six weeks.
Alan?!
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
Come on, let's go.
I get ah - -
It's anti-nature.
Can we chance moving him?
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
Hola, Juanito
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
You're married?
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
Yeah, they hate me.
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
I know.
You're sure?!
Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
Tim!  Lex!
It's safe?
I like cows.
What's that?
Please!
Why did you do this?
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
He... he's here...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
A house?
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
See this?
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
Great.	When can you do it?
What happened? Where's Jason?
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
I don't know what you could have read.
I read the one about the penal colony.
-- You appreciate my writing.
No, I left it in his office.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
I usually take lunch by the River.
Well, I --
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
In a small way.
No.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
I've heard of it happening.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Where you've been employed for seven years.
I don't know.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
What's the matter with you?
... Why take me into your confidence?
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
What's the matter?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
Then that's the place for us!
I photographed it extensively, father.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
Can you fly?
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
What about him? Yes.
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Why isn't he locked up?
Yes -- all right --
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
Arlyn Page.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
Bree --
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
You're going back?
Then, close the case.
I better keep looking.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Just send me a money order.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
Have you discussed this with them?
I wanted to give it to you first.
Town Police.
Then how are you involved?
No.
What else do you know?
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
Yes sir, we know he --
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Where is the child?
Ladies and gentlemen...
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
Yeah?
Uh huh...
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
I think I'm going to throw up.
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Objection.
It's my name too.
Yep.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Who will read me my stories?
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Objection.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
No.
No.
A heavy drinker?
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
He looks like a terrific kid.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
So...what's so terrible about that?
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
It's going to cost.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Look, Ted, all I--
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
You ever think about getting married again?
Three.  And add some basil.
No.  I don't think so.
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
Your father had been very sick.
How many?
I accept it. What is suffering?
I need to squeeze this brain.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Ask whatever you will.
What is the size of our army, now?
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
Where is that?
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Does he have the spot?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Things change, Kundun.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
I will miss you.
We have.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
It is a difficult situation.
Like my mother.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
Bastard bit my chopper.
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
So I don't like tents, why--
What are you doing?
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
I'm not mushing it.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Calm down.
It can't work.
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
He's mooing.
Hector!!
We set?
White perch.
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
Now I'm gonna puke.
I'll take it!
Is the dead guy in there?
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
You threw it at me!!
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
You like Jack?
Hector thinks you like him.
Did you get him?
Should I?
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
It's ten after nine.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
A tooth?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Part of our research--
<u>You</u>?
Backstabber?
What'd I do?
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
Sewing...
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
By the book, he's a sadist.
Yes.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
What...?
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
No. I will find you.
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
When? How?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
How long?
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Gifts?
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
Their arms?
Granted.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
I'm not a doctor.
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
No!
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
I need more light on that, Four.
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
Shit!  He sent them all.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Oh, God, she's out there...
Forty-eight hours!
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
What's going on?
The infirmary?...
No fuckin' lie...
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
How is he?
Are you sure you saw something?
Bitch!  Look what you did!
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
It's hit us all hard!
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Yes?
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
Have you counted the money?
They were going to pay, then?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
That's no way to answer the phone.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
Right, his leg's going now.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
Invitations.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
What do you mean?
. . . What?
Tom?
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
And that does include the amp?
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
What have you come as?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
I can't take any more school.
So?
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
You think I can't learn that?
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
No, sir--
Yes, sir--
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
So you knew this young man before?
You're dismissed.
You're testing me?
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Nice job.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
Just wondering.
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
You were in a fight--
Suppose not.
You've been in this house for a while?
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Uncle Al--
I got a pretty good guess.
Didn't have a father?
So how come you got into all this?
Homework?
Are we going to ever see your father?
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
You going to get married?
Maybe.
Mikey look at this--
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
You could take it--
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Senora Cruz?
I have some friends who have had a accident--
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
You thought any more about our murder?
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Sam--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
That was the night he disappeared?
What about it?
Of course you can.
Time marches on.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
No--
Yeah.
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Uh-huh.
You'd do a good job.
You think we need a new jail?
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
Sure.
So when did Buddy leave?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
Hello, L.A.
Nix.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Right.
What about death?
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
You don't?
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
Harry.
Are they treating you okay?
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
I can be very persuasive.
He was the real thing, right?
You said you weren't with him for love.
Quaid and Jennifer--
Good.  There.  Yes?
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
Where the fuck is he?
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Probably.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
Yes.
My God.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
Yes...
Harry D'Amour.
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
Have you been in?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Didn't know you read minds.
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
Is that all?
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
This is where we killed him.
You didn't try hard enough.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Ok.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
Oh.
You're possessive.
Yeah? But look at you.
That's too scary.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
I know.
You are.
What happened to your toe?
I'm going to miss you.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Charlotte?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Yes.
Well... have a good flight.
Yes?
Ok, well... I love you.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Hi, Lydia.
Is this a bad time?
Alright?
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok.
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
Sure.
See you later.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
I spaced out.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
My secretary?
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
You should think about getting professional help.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
What are you looking for exactly?
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
What did he say to you in French?
You don't want to face it.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
The police used him as a witness in this case.
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
Thanks for handling this.
How're you doin' today?
Dad around?
So what do I do?
Whatever.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
There you go.
No I don't.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
That's ridiculous.
The blue.
No, I mean I can check it for you.
Sort of.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
They ever love you back?
You shoot like a girl.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Just like that?
I don't know.  A lot.
I don't care.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Oh.
What's that?
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Why?
Four.
When'd you get this?
Then prove her wrong.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
You're not stupid.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
The "man" again.
Least you got your priorities straight.
Yup.
Funny.  I never did.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Actually, I don't...
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Maybe go back to school.
Why do you keep asking me that?
I heard enough.
For what?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
And what happens when you lose?
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Give it yourself.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
What's that, not great?
What?
What is this?
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
We were just studying.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
What?
I just told you.
Sorry.
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
Lucky kid.
From your mouth.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
You want me to fuck off?
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
What kind of Cancer?
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
Oh that's good.
It's a helluva disease.
Yeah, hey. Chad.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
OPEN THE DOOR.
...yeah...
Yeah.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
Just Jim.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
Billingsley's?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
What?
You live alone?
I want a shot of tequila too.
It's upstairs.
What happend, what's going on?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Presence - with a double ass meaning gifts I bestow, with my riff, and my flow but you don't hear me though think fast, catch me, yo cause I throw what I know with a Resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf Jackass crackas, bodystackas dicktootin niggas, masturbatin' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
I'm almost done.
Finish it up without the lip.
Did you listen to me?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
You see?
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
Gently, son --
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
He has Phil right now.
Yeah.
There's no asshole like you.
Who are you gonna call?
Who?
Jack.
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
No.
No.
I think you have the wrong number.
Let's talk about --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- let's talk more about your background --
Are you asking me that?
Yes.
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
the valley?
She's my mother.
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
Where does that name come from?
"Frank" was my mother's father.
They wouldn't?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
Oh yeah.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
Ok. What's your name?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
Are you alright?
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
Slowly or quickly?
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
I'll answer anything.
Yes.
How long with Paula?
What about now?
Do you have any children with anyone?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Well maybe.
Did you ever touch her?
Jimmy, did you touch her?
I don't know what I've done.
Are you her boyfriend?
Want me to wake her up?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
You need to sober up.
....it's alright....
Hello.
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Yes. What? Yes.
I need this one.
Yes.
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
I understand you saved my son's life today.
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
Your Majesty...
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
He who is not with us is against us.
How is he?
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
Three days??!!
Go on.
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
Bloody hell...
Then to the Bastille.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
There are more important things than tits.
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
What use am I?
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Recent hours have been a shock.
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Where is Michelle?
Continue.
You've... memorized...?
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
What do you think?
Bullshit...
What the hell happened?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
Let's roll -
What's this?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Mind if I turn out the light?
You always carry a gun with you?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
I had it all on tape...
No...I'm in some trouble...
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
Where is he?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Why not?
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
Why?
For Christ's sake, why?
Who did he ask for?
Tell me now.
What's it narrow down to?
When are you coming back?
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
Tonic will be fine.
You worked out well.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
I have work to do at the plant.
No. Reba...?
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
You'll let me go now?
No.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
I don't understand.
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
What about the dog?
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Then why?
Hello.
I want to see you, too.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Will?  You could come up here.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
She got all right?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
Yes.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
I hope you have a second chance...
You got it.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
What, you don't think I can beat him?
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Tony Clifton.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Go away.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
GET OFF!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
So?  What do they know?
It's so dirty.
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
Sir, do you have a problem?
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
We had a deal!!
Why...?  Andy, why...?
We'll need a search running.
And you are?
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
Weird.
If you get caught using that --
You don't, do you?
Hello, Trinity.
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
No, it's all right.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
Who's coming for me?
But what if...?
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
How did I beat you?
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
How...?!
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
That was a long time ago.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
Did you go to her?
You can't!
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
What are you talking about?
Which way?  Which way?
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
Cypher, I thought --
No, all we got is $40.
May God be with you.
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Who's the girl?
Kennedy.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
There won't be any this week.
I don't like loading crates.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
Don't come any closer!!!
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
I'm sleepy.
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
What, honey?
I know you do, darling.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
Oh, the goddam party --
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
I haven't been the father to you that --
Honey, please.
Paillarde of veal.
Yeah, but --
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
I didn't say.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
'Yes' to the deal?
Me, too.
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
Shall we adjourn?
For how long?  And why?
I don't care.
Yours.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
'It's up to Joe', huh?
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
No, no.  I on holiday.
Can't, sistah.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Good morning, Jennifer.
What?
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
Oh yes, I do.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Yes?
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
And I'll be a visitor.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
I appreciate you --
I mean I appreciate that.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
Has her pain abated?
No.
To bed.
You first.
He's taking a nap.
I loved it.
It gets worse.
What will we do?
When you go, I go.
A 'deal'?
Yes?
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Okay.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
Say again?
Are you threatening me?
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Yes.
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
It just occurred to me --
It's enough now.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Watch it!
Yes what?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
Eddie?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
Don't get carried away.
Uh oh --
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Daddy, what's the matter?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
What?!
Raise away.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Where is he?
This is crazy --
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
You and 'Honey'?
I'm sorry --
I've got patients coming in --
No --
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
30.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
I'm sorry... um... ?
Burt.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Where'd you get it?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Is that what your little note says?
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Yes.
Kill him.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Where is he?
Don't protect him.
What?
Don't talk about my wife.
Calm down.
What?
There's a dress code?
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
My name's Leonard.							 *
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
You really want to find this guy?
Who the fuck are you?
She couldn't.
Why?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Like what?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
Somehow, I'll know!
No. You took them out.						  *
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
What's your twenty?
We know these people...!
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
I don't know.
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
It goes very fast.
Were you born in Havana?
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Zero risk.
Why?
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
You afraid of violence?
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
What is it?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
No.
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
This is Agent James Fujima.
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
Where are you?
Alonzo...!
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Define small.
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
The Statue of Liberty.
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
And what?
They gotta be.
Hell, don't cry about it!
Gonna be like money from home.
You really want to do business?
... and taxi fare for me.
Get lost.
Tunnel?
What?
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Who?
To what?
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Where you staying, Dad?
The Hilton.
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
Not far. Just a little way.
No, I'm not afraid.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Just Erich.
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Get the... midnight... express.
What time is it?
We go back.
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
After we're outside the kogus?
You know where it is?
Why the suit?
My passport!
Hey, you can't...
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
Any luck?
You feel anything?
Which way?
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
It worked before...
The scent won't last...
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
My God.
Oh, my!
You want to read it?
What's your new book called?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
No big deal.
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
Misery's Return?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
No, just the paper will be fine.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
I'm telling you, I can't.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Have to wait.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Well, it certainly says you.
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
Yes, Paul.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
Maybe you can, Libby.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
On what.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
I suppose I did.
To win?
Feel like pleading for your life?
Where?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
What you got there, mate?
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
What are you talking about?
There she is.  I got visual.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Would you mind if I'm on top?
Indeed.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Listen to what?
They've got a book for this?
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
There's nearly 2 million in London.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
You don't trust me.
Yes?
Just like old times?
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
No.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
She sacrificed herself..
Yes, I gathered as much.
I do.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
I don't.  No exactly.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
A visit from an old friend.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
You were in the car!
Where were you?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
Are you damaged?
Why was there another team?
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
About what?
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
What sector's the air conditioning?
Zero body count.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Higher.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
What problem?
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Jim...?
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
I knew about Jim.
I don't know.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
No, I'm going.
I don't like him.
I won't pay for nothing.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
Bed.
You look tired.
Again?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
You're married.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Have you come from my brother?
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Why?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Stupid yourself.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
Why you talking to me?
I'm a wolf?
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
I can't believe what is happening.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
I can't!
But that's cause he don't know!
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Yeah.
You're late!
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
Is Johnny here?
Loretta?
Hi Loretta.
This is a good suit.
Seven-thirty.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
I have no secrets from my family.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
No.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
Hi.
I don't wanna talk about it.
It was a miracle.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
That's a pretty big sin.
No idea.
I'm sure she did.
Can I get another one of these?
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
Temperature's dropping.
No.
People home.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
You mean the whole house?
I don't know.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
How do you know she is a witch?
Get away!
Yes!
Not at all.  They could be carried.
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
No one live there.
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
What word?
You said it again!
You're a liar.
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
What is your name?
Bedevere, my Liege.
Now what happens?
Nu!
Ni, ni, ni!
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Old woman!
Yes.
Yes, I see.
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Sorry ...
Yes, Lord.
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Farewell, Concorde!
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
No ... just keep him in here.
Until you, or anyone else ...
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
No, It's nothing!
Stop saying the word!
I didn't.
I speak as I find, Archie.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
The good-looking one.
Aye, but will they?
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Checked and locked, sir.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
What did you say?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
I'm sorry?
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
You're injured.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
I do what I do.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
See what?
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Archie.
Who by?
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Ma'am?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
What can we do?
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
A fine choice, sir.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Yes.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
What do they want?
How do you do that?
Now what seems to be the problem?
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
So where is he?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
I have to talk to you.
Happy?
No way.
Well?
Change the channel!
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
What?!  There's nothing here!
So that's what we almost died for?
Yes...
It's here!!!
Is that your question?
You have no time.  What is your question?
Of course I am.
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
What did you say?
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
Someone's shut off my money!
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
It's been a very strange day.
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
So what's the problem?
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
I'll speak to someone.
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Very pleased to meet you.
Diane?
No ..........I.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
What's wrong?
Maybe it's not me.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
To my audition.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Yes, Sir.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Nice wallets.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Making ends meet, huh.
Hardly.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Why should we trust you ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
Excuse me ?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
I... I .....
Where are we going ?
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
It's fine thanks.
That's not to tough.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
I am thirty two.
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
Sir ?
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
I was.
Then what do you want ?
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
How's your foot ?
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
Are you writing a poem?
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
Don't mention it.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
I'm leaving Sunday.
You want me to move?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Was it a nice funeral?
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
She's beautiful.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
My mother can't have any more kids.
What are you staring at?
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
See you? He can smell you from there.
I guess you have.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
In the tar??
Yeah I guess...sort of.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Good. I mean...
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
No problem.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
You know how I feel about you.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Sort of?
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
Is there milk in them already?
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
It's there.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
It's no big deal.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
It's nice.
No, why?
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Can we see it from the back yard?
It's for school, for summer writing class.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Feeding my fish.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Do you like her?
My Dad was funny?
Yes it is.
He's allergic to everything.
Hi.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Did you read ALL these books?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
Where's Daddy?
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Where's your bike?
Hmmmm, interesting.
Yes.
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Got it!
Jump in the water!!
Why are you running away?
Close your eyes.
Say something it's too quiet.
Umm, Ummmmm
Seeya tomorrow.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
You like her.
Neosporin?
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
Let me rephrase that...
And the answer was so simple.
About Michael's job.
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
Is anybody watching?
I think he's been fired.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Well, you're a little early...
And she's all wrong for me!
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
Such as.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
She finds him "personable."
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Michael? What ha...
I asked you...
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
I won first prize.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
Am I disturbing you?
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Well, how about the shopping center?
Where'd he ever see us?
You're kidding.
National?
Harvard?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
She had on high heels?
No.
What kind?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Oh... Well.
Next you'll be sick.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
I don't think so.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Yes, it is --
Well...How have you been?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
I'm not sure.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Premeditated murder.
What?
Yea.
They said go see the chaplain.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Did it break?
Do you study at all?
Come on back to bed.
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Come on.
What do you think of him?
You go to school together?
Oh --
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Is that good?
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
What kind of pies do you have?
Which do you recommend?
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
By all means.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
She was born without a tongue.
Say something.
Do you have a back up.
What I'd like to do---
Manson beat you.
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Out front.
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
Hypnotizing.
Only on a much grander scale.
Yes.
That's the way of the world.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Who?
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Rollin'...and speed!
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
Really?
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
You a union man?
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
I'll smile when it's funny.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Thanks.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Any other family?
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
Went to college, huh?
Your folks live there?
Yes, aren't you?
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
How d'you mean?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
'Been up north?
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
How did it go?
What happened, Duff?
He could live with us.
Hmmm - good coffee.
You still didn't answer my question.
Uh-huh. Why?
I don't want to hurt you.
You jivin' me?
We can always do that, Duff.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Wouldn't have known you.
No, thanks.
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
How often does he get like that?
Okay.
How are you?
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
Oh yeah?
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
And then?
Did you trace it?
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
Right...
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
No problem, amigo.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
What about before that?
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
It sounds like you.
Case... Are you alright?
...And if I guess wrong?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Well, do you?
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Yes, it's lame.
Who told!
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
You don't think I can do it.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Hi!
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
He's my teacher!
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Hey there.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Is that true?
You're twenty-three years old!
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
When are you going to open your eyes?
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
You were attracted to me?
Why?
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Well, a ball player.
Yes.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Taste it.
No.
Can't you make other creations?
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Help me with this thing!
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
So, you live around here.
What are you doing here?
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
C'mon, cut it out.
Disappointed?
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
What is it?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
You want to talk about it?
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Yor dad picking the music again?
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
Horseshit.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
I used to live in this house.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
What's that?
Max, where's Kristen?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
You need me, I'll be here all night.
You got five minutes.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Call me Nancy.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
I'm serious.
That's what I know.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
To who?
Try me.
You sound like Peter Pan.
Take us there, Kristen.
We can try again.
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
I've heard crazier things this week.
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
How is he?
What did you think?
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
I'm in.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
No!
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
Fifteen million dollars.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Here we go.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
What did you say?
She saw through me.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
You like Chagall?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Who was Gilda?
How do you think I'm doing?
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Where are you going?
Yes.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Working with Leonardo.
Blimey.  What's that?
I'll see what I can do.
Still, not sparkling.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Cappuccino as ordered.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Well?
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
No, don't think I do.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
No, sir.
Hey.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
No, 'fraid not.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Spike.
No -- you're right.
Was it you?
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
What?
Why?
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Yes, Billy?
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Yes, ma'am?
I hope everything is settled.
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
M-M-M-Mack?
I second the motion!
I'll bet a dollar.
What are you doing?
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
What for?
Lobotomy?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
He can't hear you!
I'm the coach!
I don't trust you!
Let me see your hand!
No!
Why not?
Big king, too bad...
Hear what?
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
Gimme the ball!
Oh, what's that?
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
In what way?
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
Time out!
'Kay!
How do ya know that?
Somebody's coming!
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Please follow me.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Bet!
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
And you haven't heard the last of this!
What's that?
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Of course not.
Your grandmother?
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
What for?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
What's mezzaluna?
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
You're limping.
Why can't you just tell me?
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Why not?
Right now?
Hi, Peter.
You aren't?
Well.  Congratulations.
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
I can't believe you did that!
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
Well, not exactly...
Well, to-- new friends.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
What looks good?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
So what do you think?
No.
You don't have any idea?
Yes you did.
What about your job?
You don't have a passport.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
I'm hungry.
Larry bought himself cologne?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
I meant about my idea.
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Packing.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
Uh huh.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
You used to love it when I called you doll.
And you didn't tell her?
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
But my own kid bro
Maybe he gave them an argument.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
Why Edie, I
Father Barry.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Man, you were a mess!
The moment I saw you.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.
Do you like pigeons?
I don't know.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
Wham... .
And when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of Them is that your idea?
Who says?
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
Terry, you're bleeding.
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
I don't get it!
But you've got to listen to me.
About Edie?
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Is Johnny in?
Do you?
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
Listen, Johnny
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
Keep Charley out of this.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
But they are not yet one of us.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
I would have time for my own pleasures!
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
Oh, if there is only time!
Is there time?
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Nice disguise.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
Just hung up.
Two hours.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
You ever wear one of these?
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
And what happened to Carl?
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
Leave it where it is.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Ironic, isn't it?
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
The fuck you talking about?
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
You don't seem all that scared.
You don't act like it.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Is that right?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Peter Finch.
Nothing.
Unless you wanna tell me.
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
Those guys bother you?
Is that how you think of yourself?
What, as a sales rep?
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
Weren't you expecting us?
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
I thought you guys were busted.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
You goin' right back to work?
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
For a time.
Meaning?
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
You're not?
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
Why's that?
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
Can I do what?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Dad...
Was it Foley?
I don't have any idea.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
I found a rubber.
Are you sure they're here?
Yeah.
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Land of the free...
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
I was grieving too.
Get me into a plane!
Where are we going?
What's there?
Fun today.  Like old times.
We've always tried to beat each other.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
It's not getting any longer.
You were more like brothers.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
Bombers.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
Sorry to trouble you.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Leapin' Jesus!
Do you have to wear that hat?
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
And we're here on the couch...
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
Yeah. Like that.
He's trying.
I love you.
Come back to me.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
Terry! Slow down.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
I wish she hadn't.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
This is great reefer.
What are you shooting for?
I'd love to.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
It's Charlie!
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
Damn that Charlie I
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
He'll win.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
For what?
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
You look exactly the same.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
I came to say goodbye.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
What?
Yes... why?
What's wrong?!
Is this a good spot?
Why not?
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
How long have you been here?
Mom...
Jesus.
What in God's name... ?
Bob...
Allright. Calm down.
Do you really think so, Andy?
Why, Beckett?
Don't apologize for me.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
Maybe you should think about it.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
About my blood work?
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
New baby?
One week old.
Big trouble.
They sabotaged me.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Uh huh...
Beckett?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
What happens?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Yes.
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
Yes.
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
No.
Yes.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Mom?
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Were you pleased with his work?
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
Let's continue.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
Charles...
What? What is it?
You came for us....
Bring the light!
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
Here. Make it easy on you.
Hey.
We just keep him locked up forever?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Like what?
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
He can pilot?
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
Well? Is it just the pump?
Some prophet guy?
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
And pointless.
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
"God is Great," yes?
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Not a star-jumper.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
I apologize.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
Do you have any weapons?
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
It's probably wrong --
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
This is a joke in very poor taste.
With one of them.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
It's him...Landon.
You! ... You knew about this?
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
This is his assertion.
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
I was wrong.
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
...But what'd she do?
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
Must be somebody?
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Right on.
Right...
I don't know.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
I see.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
What did you say his name was?
You're drinking it.
Do you think I don't?
You tried to run away.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
What time is it?
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
All right--following me.
Anything I can do about it?
No percentage in that.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
Do you have to leave the note?
If you're doing all this just for me.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Mitchell was dead enough.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Do you think I was faking?
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Please answer my question.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
I expected nothing else.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
All right. Get him.
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
What's a buzzer?
Where?
How are you two getting along?
It could have been an accident.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
Did I do something wrong?
Passkey?
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Got a moment, Inspector?
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
Would you?
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
I've met her.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
I never saw it before.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
Nice.
You ought to know why.
That's not very kind.
What's this?
Years, why?
How about your new friend?
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
Hello.
And some of that.  Sorry.
Are you going to have coffee?
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I thought it was tremendous.
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
Oh yes?
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
I might.
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
To the airlift.
Not yet you know any of these people?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
Thanks.
Suez.  1956.
That's good.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
Now listen...
You're so famous now.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
I won't.  Goodnight.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Thanks for stepping in.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
Talk.
I can't do this.
Three seconds... two... one...
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
Sir?
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
They took a left at the next light!
Angelo!  Don't fire!
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
What's goin' on?
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
No way, old buddy.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Your uncle will like this.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
No.
What's your name?
For an hour.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
And why do you say that?
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
What are assets?
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
All right.  How much for the week?
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
This isn't a date.
The Rex.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
You won't.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
Love this car!  Is it new?
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Carlos had some great rock.
He... he just does.
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
It was great.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Oooh, I love those.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
Are you looking for something in particular?
Having a good time, Vivian?
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
Hear this now: I will come for you.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
-- where?
Have you any money?
A book?
Oh no. No, please.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
Why? You can't even lift one.
-- yes --
-- all that I have and more please --
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
We'll wait until you're ready.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
No one of consequence.
I must know.
Kill me quickly.
Making sure nobody's following us.
You know what a hurry we're in.
You're that smart?
Morons.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Good, what is it?
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
What did I do?
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
What???
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Where would you like to eat?
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
What are you doing?
Do you think he'll take the job?
Vat about it?
Min Bialystock.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Like clockwork.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
I solemnly swear...
Nietzche...
The Graf Spee...
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
I'm not the police.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
How did she pay you?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
What's your interest?
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
Yes.
Did he say anything about my sister?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Is Mary... in trouble?
I ought to call the police right now!
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Our Deputy sleeps.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
This is the old highway.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Hospital clean.
What is it?
You can't go up there.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
Can you?
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
Thank you. Again.
I'd like to.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
You go out... with friends?
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Frankly, yes.
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
I'll get your bags.
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
You didn't find anything.
Did you wish to see someone?
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Well, news of Buckley?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
You here again?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
What is it?
That called ... commanded ...
There's no child here.
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
That's the way I feel about it.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
What! What are you talking about?
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Which one is me? The horse?
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
I used to be married to one.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
No kiddin'.
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
Cry-baby?
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
Why?
How much money have you got?
What is it? What happened?
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
Fire insurance!
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
To lunch.
But I have some friends waiting.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
I'd know him anywhere.
We flopped the first time out.
What universe are you in, Paul?
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Dysfunctional --
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Yes?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Don't mention it.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
All right, what do you know?
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
What did you say, Brother?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
I think Daddy suspects.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
How could that be, son?
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
Boys? You say to me boys?
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
What did you forget?
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Strange voices, Rose?
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
Well, it's Billy.
Well, it was a silly question.
I don't believe it.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
More history, Rose.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
Where you gonna be?
Yeah.
Clench your teeth.
That's sick.
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
They... they shot me.
What's mine say?
No, we're stealing.
Our resignations.
You going rogue on me?
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
It's our job.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
Slow down.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
Oh yeah?
What... ?  Not you too?
Dead.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
I can't do it, Ben.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
I can't kill my own father.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
Fine. Together again, huh?
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I'm sorry.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Come on! Come on!
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
I'm going in.
What's he saying?
Yes. It's you Leia.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Yoda, I must know.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Well I want to leave.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
You're OK by me.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Now I
Oh my, my,
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Oh no no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
I just dislocated my finger.
D'you really wanna call?
I think he might be worried.
It's fine.
Do me another favor?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
What did you say about a pet shop?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Apollo?
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
...Like you?
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
You're hurtin', man!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
Damn.
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
...Still don't feel no heat.
I don't like ya face.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Seven minutes!
Six!
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Black market?
What?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Come July, twenty-five.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Here's the card?
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
Don't you care what the people will say?
God bless ya, Rock.
How I look out there, Mick?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Hey --
Maybe another job is the best thing.
How ya feelin'?
I got whiskey here.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
Whatta these guys want?
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
What can I do about it?
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
You serve martinis, doncha?
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
You?
Toon cops worked me over.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
I got him on loan from Disney.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
By my head here come the Capulets.
Is the day so young?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Young Romeo is it?
I'll not endure him.
He shall be endured
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
If my heart's dear love--
By the hour of nine.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
You were a soldier, were you?
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
I take it you still want the money...
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
You should really let a doctor look at that.
So what is it you want to know?
They call me Swede.
Is that right?
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Where to?
To see a man about a thing.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
Know what?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
Not exactly.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
It is at that.
You think?
So I do it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
That's a good question.
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
I told you, I quit.
Sort of!
I don't know what you're -
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Never heard of it.
We don't know that.
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
We're not?  How do you figure that?
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
How much?
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
Yeah?  So?
Great...
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
I don't know.
Don't you have to be here?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Dwayne.
Something wrong, Jesse?
What are you saying?
Yeah let's hear about your day.
I'm not asking.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
Don't hurt me.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
How's work?
Well I don't know --
Yeah.
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
El Capitan?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
What's wrong?
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
You.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
Follow the Rich White Man?
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
How do you know?
You pull a muscle or something?
No.  It was my singing.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
No.  It's not right.
What's she doing?
Wait!  There's people down there!
There's people up here!
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
Why did you help me?
Fine with me.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
No mu-shu.
What about a little king pao chicken?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Very nice.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
We made it, man.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
First class.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Is this a payoff?
What's going on?
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Good job.
He stole my wheel!
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
What?
That silly-ass look on your face.
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
Did you make the plate?!
Stool pigeon.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Want some?
What?!
I am from outa town.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
Oh my god. Griffin.
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
The Feds?!
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Yo, Johnson...
What?!
Nobody touches me.
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
Hello.
Yes.
My daughter.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
I was trying to find the right time.
I will not have friends in America.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Rub your ears.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Fisher, let him talk.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Then come for dinner.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
And you are?
It's nice that they're still friends.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
You're going to be very disappointed.
We'll see.
Give me that!
Seven-fifty.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Where did you disappear to?
Lost!
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
I'm going to kill myself.
But I'm weird.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
No.
Is there somebody else?
You take the microwave?
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
-- who's married to --
I'll wait.
What is it?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
No.
What was what?
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
No, I'm not. 
Okay.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
I want my money.
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
What?
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
How amazing.
Sure you do.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
It's not that late in Seattle.
No.
Why not?
Yeah.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Seventy... eight.
You'll see.
It plays in 50 states.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
Does red pepper go under R or P?
Fine.  Fine.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
-- a slice of pizza --
Will she scratch up your back?
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Like do you believe in heaven?
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Why is she bringing that bag?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
I was thirsty.
Everyone at work heard you.
It's a short word.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
If I didn't go.
Okay.
Well...
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
Oh.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Mornin'.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
Who? A scab?
No, Estellita.
What's the matter?
They say I am no good to you.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Will you be still?
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Where's your mama?
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
Are you Australian?
This man sounds like a real catch.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
Is that how you play?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
Nice day
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
When? When did you ever see me use?
No one ever noticed?
You don't trust me?
By not disgracing her memory!
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Why do you say that?
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Just some buddies.
Murder.  Beautiful.
Please ... don't do this ...
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
To who?
What?!
He's the only one I told.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Nervous?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
What is that? Rum and coke?
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
The Army gave you that?
Yep.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
He ain't Wade.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
That only leaves three.
I wonder where they're going.
You?  Leading a squad?
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
Maybe.
You think they'll be alright?
Three for three.
How about I go right, sir?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Uh, oh.
Trust me, you're the best.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Thank you, sir.
Lingerie.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
Demolition, right?
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
How can you, how can you say that?
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
Good for her.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
Gee, it's easy.
Lloyd.
Hang in there, man.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
I don't feel anything.
Lloyd is doomed.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
Did he ever get rough with you?
I like him a lot.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
Honey!
What am I supposed to think?
You think you know what this money is?
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Thank-you.  The real world.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Well, not monumentally.
Well...
Goodbye.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
So it's an honor?
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Stop by later.
Okay, bye.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
It did?
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
Well, I need to study, and...
It sounded like you did.
No.
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
Okay.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
No.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
I know this part, keep reading.
Just her name.
So what's up?
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Oh boy.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Oskar - my friend Lena.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Now you're back.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
I'm sorry to hear that.
We started without you.
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
What's going on?
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
You asked for shoe polish.
That's great.
Yeah.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
It kind of looks that way.
Yes.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
I'm losing you.
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
Can we talk?
Did it?
It helped me realize one thing.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Tons and tons.
No, I don't.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
What's your subject?
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Two.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
A twist ending if you will.
Or it found us.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
They're roomates.
This is all too familiar.
Yeah, right.
Just in case...
No, wait...
Are you in danger now?
Don't do this.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
Easy black boy.
You're not allowed to ask that.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
Hello?
She's not here right now.
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Can I help you?
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
What did you know about your mother?
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Oh yeah, how?
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Detective Kincaid?
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
Why would the police come to you?
Always.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Has anyone else every used your phone?
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Who is this?
Yes.
Yeah?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Are you sure?
No I need to call you. Just you.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
Billy? What the...
Now that it's out of your system.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
You heard me.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
You don't still think it was me?
Fuck you.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Yes.
Do I?
I don't think so.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Why do you want to know my name?
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Nah, I don't think so...
Don't hang up on me.
Dial someone else, okay?
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
I wanna play a game.
...please...
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
...please... no...
No it's not. It was Jason.
And why is that? Has something happened?
Evening, ma'am.
Deputy... good evening.
You never know when or where a story will break.
So is Dewey your real name?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
You girls ready.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
What's the plan?
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
...out at the airport...
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
You coming tonight?
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
Yeah.
Why are they doing this?
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Are you serious?
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Do you really think Billy did it?
Take a message.
I don't know...
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
What do you think about when you're having sex?
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
Give it to me.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
What time is it?
Where we headed?
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Murderers?
Murderers like you?
We would have gotten you eventually.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
This doesn't make any sense.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
What about sports?
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
And, if it's a threat.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
Nothing.
What?
Does this make it with you?
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
Well, that was money well spent.
So they ran our list.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
We're focusing.
It's not what you think it is.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
Are you alright?
You stupid son of a...
Then, he must write about these murders.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
Where's the victory?
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
Wait!
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
Anything... anything missing or different.
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
I don't know, with this case.
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
Another one, eh?
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
What good does that do?
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
You got any more orders, Captain?
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Told ya, didn't I?
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Because she's my...my...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
He just couldn't wait...
Nine...  Ten!
Well, you're a widower now...
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Comancheros...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
It still worked in town.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Where have you been all day?
For God's sake, what happened to me?
You didn't tell her!
Oh
You have the money?
Tomorrow.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
So now you are free to love
That's me.
Cut his nose off.
Very well.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
What happened to Sam?
Do you know it?
It is all locked safe in here
Who is she this time?!
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Where are you going?
Romeo.
Kit
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
"Of love?"
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Your Majesty.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
"Madam!"
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I know how to fight!
Will! What--?
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
Virginia?!
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
She loves me, Thomas!
I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
She sings too?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
A theatre poet?
What's his name?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
What?
I'm only asking what you think.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
I don't know.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Now.
How much?
Security.
Doesn't it worry you?
What? Yes, that's fine.
Are you recording it?
Well, then?
What?
That's right.
What I am.
So what's wrong with that?
Yes.
I wonder how he did it?
Did what?
I thought we all were.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Are you all right?
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Oh, good.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
I'll wait there.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Alex.
Are you all right?
You mustn't take it so badly.
What?
You mean I can have the room?
Of course.
Two?
Who said there were four?
You're sure of that.
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred.
What?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
What happened to that guy?
What guy?
You must be Hugo.
What?
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Both, sir.
Don't you think there's too much gold?
I thought you were in a good mood.
Why?
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
My keys.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
What're you doing later?
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Like what?
No.
Are you in love with her?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
Okay.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
Why?
You are.
I went to school with her husband.
Buffums?
Whew.
And what?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Did you?
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
-- gee...
-- yeah.
We're friends.
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
No --
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
Yeah!
-- White ladies?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
Jackie Shawn.
I just... who what?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
You're great.
We live together now.
Great.
Egypt!
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Now, Jackie --
-- and take this with you.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
I just want to know, that's all.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
George, now cut this out.
Yes, yes, I did.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
But what?
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
Oh, hey...
-- yeah?
This really ought to be layered...
All night.
I wanna hear about it, George.
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
I'm not anti-Establishment.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
No thanks.
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
I mean, how did that happen?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
What took you so long?
Wasn't sure it was you.

No.

I'm coming over.
George is going to open a shop.
Who were you talking to?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
It must be something.
Well, you know what I mean.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
It's been so long I don't how long?
-- Yesss?
Egypt?
But why Egypt?
Sort of.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
I don't think so.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
-- what's the problem, honey?
No, it's not that...
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
Where to, Les?
Dad?
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
How's it going, Doc?
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
Tony.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
All right.
It's so pretty.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy...
Mommy... Mommy...!
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
How?
She eh... interferes.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
What time is it?
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
He's still asleep.
Get him out of here?
Stay away from me,
Stay away...!
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.
Wendy...
Mr. Ullman?
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Sure, Uncle Al.
What's the money for?
Rats...
Huh?
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
You want to know what I think?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I saw what I saw.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
And you listen to that?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
What?
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
Thanks.  A lot.
This prom is a real drag.
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
It's true -- I know her.
What a shame!
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Like this place?
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Babies
She's a pro.
Is there any syrup?
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
She won't?  Why not?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
Mary Clarence!
Bobs
I don't want to mess anyone up...
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
St. Anne's?
A what?
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
Yes.  Until breakfast.
And whom would you call?
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
What?
You're my Olympic event.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
What?
I must go where I can be of use.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
Ten flights?
Like what?
I just need a few more weeks,
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
What?
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
We could put you into our witness protection program.
Who are you guys?
But you didn't tell me!
And if she runs?
It didn't work, Vince.
She's gettin' away!
You didn't shoot!
What's she doing?
It should be here any minute.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
I lied.
If we could speak alone.
Who took the meat?
They spend two days in chains.
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
We must be a curious sight to him.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
No, I couldn't...
What is it?
All I saw was their lantern.
Lady Van Tassel.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Climb up!
Lady Van Tassel...
What can we do?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
These scars.  How did you get them?
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
Why would you do such a thing?
What are you on about?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
Blood.
What is so urgent?
Katrina...
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
No.  She has gone out.
What did you say?
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
What you got that's good to eat?
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
What you got in there, warshing?
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Don't tell me what to do.
It went real good.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I know Albert. We're friends.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
You believe in the Bible?
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
Childers.
They let you out?
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
Oh, jackin' off?
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
A little ol' boy.
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
What you readin'?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
We'll be on teams, me and you?
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Yes sir.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
I know he does.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
I ain't got no boy.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
I never was no good with history.
I'll be.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
Yeah.
Yes sir.
Naw, I ain't.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
He just got out of the state hospital.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
What!
It's my birthday.
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Are you closed?
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Yeah, probably.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
It means "happiness."
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
Where to?
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
It'll never be finished.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
And how much are these?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
How the hell did you get into the building?
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
You mean Rashid?
I shouldn't have let him go.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Benefits?
What do you want me to say?
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Yeah? And why is that?
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
So what's the time?
I mean breakfast.
Mostly what.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
He's dead?
What time is it?
Eight-thirty?
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
I just did.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
Oh, yeh?
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
A thousand.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Yes.  Initially.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
You think so?
What for, Sheriff?
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
No.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
The same.
I already said that, b...
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Can I say something, here?
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
What did he say?
Those two musicians from the garage!
I'll say.
We're not?
They got the bull-fiddle.
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
Watch it, Daphne!
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
He's going to be ashore with you.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
What happened?
I'm engaged.
You think he's too old for me?
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Yeah - Josephine.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
What for?
I was it.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Personally, I'm Type O.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
You must be quite a girl.
I'll throw up!
Daphne...
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
We'll adopt some.
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
What's the job?
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
We'll take it!
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
No - funerals.
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
Brains aren't everything.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
About what?
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Thanks, honey.
What makes you so sure?
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
Up, up, up.
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
Why?
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
You're flattering me.
Complete washout.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Oh, no!
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Is that anything?
I think you're on the right track.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
I never join nothin'.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
I cut myself shaving.
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
I already told you.
Why wouldn't I?
Well, we all got to go sometime.
Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always this or that. Youre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Ill just check into a hotel.
You heading to the train station?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Hey.
Shrink, actually.
Hey, you!
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Not for a dog.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
Youre funny.
Who are they?
What is?
How did you know that was me?
Oh, no.
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Subtle?
Is this for last night?
But nothing did.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
So, whyd you say yes to me?
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Who is they?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Whatcha wanta order?
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Where you goin'!?
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
What... are you?
There are more important matters right now...
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
What's going on, Chef?
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Who is it?
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
That's gonna take a long time!
What's a butfor?
Be careful, dude.
It's so very cold...
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
That was sweet!
Nowhere.
I don't know, dude.
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Does it say what the clitoris is?
Oh, brother.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
But I-
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Yeah!
What's the matter, Wendy?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
You didn't?
Oh yeah...
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
You're ready for the real thing?
What?  What are you talking about?
What the hell are you doing?
Marry you?
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
I'm fine.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
Where's Taylor?
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Is it safe for human transport?
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Sorry about your loss.
La da da dalala...
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
- canker sore.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Theo.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
They suspended me for 100 years.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
You got a better offer?
The whole world thinks you're underground.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
After we eat, Dad.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
132, 154.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Get that outta your mouth!
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
He's my father, Millie.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Uh...over easy.
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Business.
This is a vicious cycle.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
Too late for what, Sheila?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
You should.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
Very professional.
Open it, Captain!
Get out of there!
Back away then.
Wait a minute --
Yeah.  I heard you.
What if it attacks?
High Voltage?
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
How deep is he?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
You don't think weapons are important?
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
You think he killed Edmunds?
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Radiation shield, you think?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Sir, about leaving --
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Wait a minute.
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Why should I go?
In case you die, too?
The refridgerator.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
What?
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Diphenyl parlene.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Three to six hours.
You want to kill him?
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
I never went in that sphere.
Shut up, Beth --
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Beth!
Beth?
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Well, what's your theory?
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Fine.  I'm fine.
C'mon, Norman.
Nice work, Norman.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
What is it, Harry?
... you there?  Norman?
Wisconsin's your answer.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
You know how to work this thing?
You mean forget?
What does Norman already know?
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Do you?
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Norman Johnson.
The others, sir?
Captain who?
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
You've heard of me?
Well, he's polite.
What kind of a crash was it?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
I don't know.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Who are you anyway?
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
The Kiber Crystal.
You're Starkiller?
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
Who's the pilot?
Why didn't you say so before.
I think she's going to be all right.
Watch it!  Move back.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
What an honor...
Something... I've got...you don't.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
He was our teacher... He was great.
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
Saddle up, Roughnecks !
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
How do you make him do that ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
You always told me you couldn't do human...
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Or...?
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
A funeral.
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
None at all... We won.
Who cares ?
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
What's wrong with you ?
...I'm sorry.
That was just a mix up.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.
Flip six, three hole.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Mr. Rasczak.
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
Is that your signature, Rico ?
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Best in the Fleet !
Can you walk ?
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
What does that mean?
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Yes.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
I am seeking answers, Captain.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Go you Huskies?
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
I need a typewritter.
That: in an act of...
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
Yes...
How can you <u>say</u> that?
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
<u>How</u>...?
What happened?
Gonna' be good as new.
Oh, God...
The other side.
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
Sure did.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
Now you're talking...
What are you going to do?
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
I'm sorry.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.

"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
What?
...wants a piece...
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
An artist of your caliber...
The minute I read that script I said...
...yes...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...

Kiss my ass.

I...
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
We're out of money.
I've got a date.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
I don't getcha.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
No.
How do you know you saw it?
They're coming Fedex...
It's just a formality.
I don't got the money.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
If you do the product placement...
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
She wasn't in...you were al...
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
She coulda done better than him.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
It just slipped out.
...why do you think?
Then why are you putting on mascara?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Look she's upset --
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
Like how?
I hope it's the right kind.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
You lost Ben?!
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
She still packing for her trip?
That's so weak.
Help me here...
No.
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
Poof!  You're happy now.
That's Rache's song!
No!  I have to get there.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
It's not good enough.
And when did that pass?
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
Rachel's not half my age.
We're not discussing your age.
Napalm.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Our children.
Not to me.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Not personally.
She was angry at herself.
Jackie?
You feeling all right?
Did I hear the word...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
Oh, my God.
I really look like shit.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
And I'm going to win.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
So I'll have to order in?
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
Rache, it may take time.
Can we go sit somewhere?
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
No prob. I'm cool.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Oh. How did it happen?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
He wasn't.
But still, you can't be sure.
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
The camerawork's nice.
OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.
Don't even joke about that!
Mom?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Sure!...
What are you going to do?
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Ready for tomorrow?
Huh?
What do you want?
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
You're welcome.  Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
You're not.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Say, Ni...
'Fuck me hard!'
Again!
Any books you like to read for fun?
No.
I hate reading.
Hello, is this Pam?
That's too bad.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
OK. Bye.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
You know...I like you.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
He did?
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
What do you mean?
Cooper...
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
What about Cooper--where is he?
She's as good as gone...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
What the hell is it, anyhow?
I say we head out.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
That's nonsense, and you know it!
My seven body orifices????
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
Now, snap out of it, fella!
What?
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Yes, sir.
Why do you think I ask?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Yes, sir.
Condition Red!
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Plan-R????
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
That is correct, Major.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Suppose that were the case?
I know that, sir.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
I guess so.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Do you think we'd cheat?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
They're coming in now.
How many planes did we lose?
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
Where'd they get you?
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
What do you mean?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Have you tried the emergency system?
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
Yeah.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Yeah.
Your a nurse?
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
It's your birthday?
No, no.
Ah!
A long, long, long...
No, I mean, no one.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
Look.
Yeah, man.
Ah, you know people there?
Come on.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Score! Yeah!
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
Are you talking to me?
Glad it's okay.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
What's up guys?
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
He is.
He is.
Mm.
It's a mistake to think that.
I'm not a nice guy.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Oh, wow.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
I hit her.
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
No.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
God, I haven't seen you all day.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
How?
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Us.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Mm-mm.
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Well, what about us?
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Good, man.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
So you think I should?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Well, not exactly.
So who are you?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Is that your driver?
Look at you!
Oh!
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
You're not serious.
I'm moving.
No, I'm going.
Is that Jeff?
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Tim?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
It's none of my business?
Don't do that.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
You sure?
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Madonna.
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Don't use big bills!
Yeah?
Ammo?
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Uh...maybe?
All of you!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
That was the general idea.
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
It will?
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Hello, young fellow.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Yeah?
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
Where do you live?
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
A little.
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
That's what I told them.
You made her a star?
We've come for the car.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Bring something to drink.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
What do you want?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
You love me?
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
How do I fight it?
A little.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
Finished your estimate?
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
Nurse! Nurse!
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
No!
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Did anybody notice you?
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
What? Me?
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
That was meant for me!
What's it like?
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
Yeah? What do you want?
Brad.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
Peanut butter and jelly.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Call me.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
Well...  Not quite like this.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
When?
What?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
What will it get me?
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
Turn on the light.
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
What's wrong?
Where did it come from?
So?
A normal person.
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Uh. . .
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
I'll try to remember that . . .
Good. My heart can't take it.
I'll be alright.
It's beautiful.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
Sensible enough.
Where?
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
Put down Lex Luthor !
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Look, they need a machine to fly.
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Well, I don't understand.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
But why the hair?
The one Superman wrecked up?
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
Are there any more at home like you?
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Stop him, Clark!
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
Listen...thank you.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Besides that.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
This??
So I've noticed.
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
Bet he makes it.
Shut up.
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
-- as we will be.
Lara, please...
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Superman???
You think they're strange?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
Thirty-five.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
I still don't get it.
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Of time, Luthor.
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
Ally.  That was my nickname.
We're...not together.
What...does it turn to?
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Alison.
Say hi to Zoe.
I understand.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
It's natural.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
You believe that?
Why did you do that, Billy?
What do you mean?
Excuse me?
So do you like your new room?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Did he say what about?
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
It's like a song.
Nicole?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
Have they ever been busted?
Perfect.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
News?
Yes.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
Who are you?
Yes.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
Before the actual accident?
I was scared.
You could see the speedometer?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
No.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
Do you like the colour?
The door needs a lock.
There's talk of that.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Is "he" inside?
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Not being partial, are you?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
I didn't say that, J.J.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
But what?
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
If that's for me, tear it up!
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Please... let... the kids... go...
What does that mean?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
What?
You will.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
I know!
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
You look like handmade shit.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Why attack Russia?
I have detailed files.
On Furtwängler.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
I guess so, sir.
I guess it's possible.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
Yes.
Three months.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Think you can get me any of that?
I'm sorry.
Of course.
I can't do this. It's not right.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
Yes, von der Null.
Von der Null?
Yes, I know who he is.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
What?
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
Yeah?
He did?
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
You were in insurance before the war.
Like this bandleader.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
Yes, Chuck?
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
I don't understand...
You cold?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
That's not my mission.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
I bet you're ticklish.
And who was the enemy?
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Projections were far too optimistic.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
Don't just stand there, get help!
There's got to be a flashlight.
See you around.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
Where are we going?
What are you doing... ?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Scams, con games.  How many?
Who's responsible?!
What are you doing?
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Like... where are you from?
Julliard, yeah.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
Like a stroke?
Are you still on mediction?
Slow down, take a breath...
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Do you know how to change a tire?
You're part of it...
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
What?
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
What's all this for?
What kind of vacation?
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Where?
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Dinner's in the oven.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
What makes you ask?
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
Look, where is he?!
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
I don't like her.
Why are you following me?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
Well, I... uh...
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
And those are Luke's and mine.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
I, I just can't...
Eleanor, how was the drive?
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
Welcome Home.
Someone is playing with you.
I don't know.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Why do you need a chain like that?
Who?
What did it cost?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
How could he have left without his keys?
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
I think so.
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
What'd you come back for, babe?
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
Then what good is he?
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
We think someone is here.
No.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
You should have let me do the talking.
Huh?
You're in gun country now, my friend.
No reason.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
And that's where you met Jenny.
Has he?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
That would be too easy.
He's gotta know why.
Not much -- you?
Sort a few things out.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
That's what was estimated.
Right.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
You don't seem bothered.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
Hey?
Just now?  Overnight?
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
You ever been to London?
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Up the coast.
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
Eh?
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Yeah?
Been away a lot.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
What d'you mean, any happier?
There is?
You do?
Like what.
Walked.
I miss my kids.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Ah.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Thanks.  You, too.
What.
...Yes?
Ann--
Oh, Mr Crane--
He didn't say that.
...Uh-huh.
...I guess I've been all wet.
Birdy--
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
I can get it, yeah.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
I'll have it in a week.
Mm.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Yeah.
That was quite something.
Yeah.
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
Uh-huh.
Ah.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
His eyes are open.
Uh... you're under arrest.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Anything missin'?
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Where's the walk-in safe?
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
I smell it.  It's here.
Got my hands full here.
What's that?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
What is it?
What's that?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
We're not supposed to go back there.
I don't want to go this way.
They were yellow!
What?
That's impossible.
Is Dr. Frock safe!
My God.  Then it was an animal.
Genetic damage?
Hide quickly!
We have to try and draw it off!
I don't believe it.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
Where exactly?
It's the busy season.
What happened down there?
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
--a dead one at that.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Amnesia.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
How can they have a child?
You think she'd go through with it?
Lauren, right?
No.
Well, what do you want to do?
Yeah?  Outta what?
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
What're we doing here, Truman?
What exactly?
Yeah...
What's that?
Oh, God.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
I won't be here Sunday.
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
Truman, what about that sign?
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
--How do you know about that?
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
What is it you find incredible?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
You've got something to show me.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
And what's that?
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
A plague?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
How can I reach you?
That would be my guess.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Why?
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
What did you find?
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
And you've never seen anything like that?
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
Very weird.
Scully....?
I can't go any farther.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
Is she alive?
What do you mean, walked?
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
What alien environment?
My god...
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
She adores you.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Four and twenty blackbirds...
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
With Stargher I saw things...
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
Then what is he?
Evil.
If you believe that.
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
It doesn't matter...
Oh no... No you don't.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Give her some cigarettes.
Thank you.
Sit down.
You were awfully good.
No.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
His own doctor?
...at all.
Do I...
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
We're both in it, Harry.
...again.
I shall be all right.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
Why are you lying?
Nichts danke. Kein.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
Joseph Harbin...
He works in a military hospital.
That's what we want to find out.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
What?
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Get the next plane.
...a week ago.
...in the morning.
Calloway!
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
What time is it?
It's a military hotel.
Very good, sir.
Hello, Harry.
I want to talk to you.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Could he have been at all conscious?
You saw it?
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Oh, you did.
Something wrong.
Joseph Harbin.
Third Man.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Richard - I saw a fin!
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Not too bad.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
So?
You think?! Based on what?
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
That's a movie, you moron.
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
People still need values, beliefs....
Why no silencer?
What's he care about?
Your father??
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
Nazis talk about it all the time.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
What'd you say?
An investment banking house.
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
What??!?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Are all Jews the same?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Think about your father. Your sister.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
What is happening?
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Who told you that?
That's all we've got left.
Who even knew?
Mrs. Moebius.
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
It's Friday....
We tested the new bomb.
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
He's shy, not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
What's happened??
You're right.  You're fired.
Hello!
This is a great pleasure.
You forgot the Hula!
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
I won't, I swear.
He can learn.  He is learning.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
... What's your name again?
I dove 315 feet!
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
People say that?
Everything about what?
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
Good night.
You were right.
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
You jumped in?
How can you tell it's a female?
I'm going back home.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
I'm still here.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
... Not at all.
I didn't dive.
What are you doing?
Promise me one thing.
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Assassin!
In my apartment?
You called the police?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
What are they for?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Please. Will you help me?
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
Want to get a drink?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Esther!
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Mom! We're eating!
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
What's wrong with him?
How do we bypass it?
What are you doing?
Is he in love with you?
What did they say before the bad card came up?
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 
Hey  I'm over here.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
No.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
What are you getting at?
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
Excuse me?
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Are we understood?
Mr Lombard?
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesnt suit you! Who knew Id found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands?
Leon hung himself...
Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
To get me killed...?
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
I know where to look.
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Hi...
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
Tomorrow?
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
What kids?
I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
How many of you scumbags are here?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelquun récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Its about the puppy. You got the money?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Its wet. Will this do?
Can I get up now?
Do you know Leons parents names?
Uh-huh.
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Cinq cents.
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Better today than tomorrow.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Well...
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
But it is what I want.
To be killed in battle?
Jeanne's alive!
We have to press home the attack!
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
And?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
Yes, probably... maybe...
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
Who are you?
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
What were you doing when the voice came?
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
You did well...
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I... I never lied!
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
What are you doing on the wall?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Yes I am.
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
I want to be with him always...
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
How long have you been married?
When's your baby due?
What's happened?
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Can you help us?
I've no money.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
We're recruiting.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
What d'you mean, take the table away?
What's this about?
Boys, boys...
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
Very appropriate.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
What's your work?
What's all that gunfire?
What's happening?
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
What's he say?
On your property?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
Everyone has to practice.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
She wants it to come.
What does she say?
He's given it to us.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Which way are the rooms?
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Which one?
Who's got the contract?
Yes sir.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You know anything about him?
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
No.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Then why you doin' it?
You wanta wait for your share?
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
The wire is ten years outa date.
Looks like he's sulking.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Who are you?
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
He'll never do it.
What about this Rosebreen?
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Said he stole his invention.
Mind if I look around?
Oh, Andy.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
You're high enough.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
What is it?
No.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
I didn't.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
Which way did she fall?
Forgive me.  How are you?
A new invention?
I know -- I know --
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
That woman!
I never saw him before.
So would I.
No.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
I see.
But he's interested!
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Don't you remember....
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
What'll I do if something comes up?
Is Julia going with you?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Hello, Mimi.
Well, don't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
All right - you didn't.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
What am I?  The fall guy?
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Much better, thanks.
Maybe a drink would help you.
You're a fine watch dog.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Finished with these?
Hello... send him up.
What's the matter with you?
Maybe I will.
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Mimi...
Trying to put it off on her?
I just wanted to tell you...
Home!
Home?
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
They shouldn't have been here.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
There's nothing we can do.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
What happened?
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
I have to answer him.
At-at-at-at-at.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
They'll shoot us!
...I know.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
They're going to kill us!
Get up and dig.
Wait.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
How!?
What if he's not?
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
I pick that way.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
Well?
An Iraqi?
What do we do?
I don't know!
...Wes...?
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Epps?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Woods.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
What is this?
Now you need me.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
That's in two days.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
I thought we were dead.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
How long we going to keep this up.
What do you think?
What the hell are you doing!?
I think he wants something to drink.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
Then why did you bring it up?
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
What time is it?
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
no...no, no.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
It's the end.
Who?  Who's leaving?
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
Where's LUH?
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  Check cybernetic manual F-45.  If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation.  This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are.  Authorities will arrive shortly.
-Where?
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Who the heck're you?
Where did you get this?
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
What's up?
Where you guys at?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Fuck factor?
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
You okay?
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Nice to be here.
Captain...
What?
Goddamit, Reilly--
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
And it had diamonds in the back.
No!
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
And as for you, waiter--
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
Very well, m'sieu.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
The tennis player?
Thank you!
Sweetheart, what day is today?
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
Five, seven, and nine--
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
I know that niche.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
What's wrong now?
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
How do you like my dress?
Beautiful.
Hair?
You would?
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
<u>Adolph</u>?
Adolph J. Giron.
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
But you're the more intelligent one.
That's true.
Then why did you do it?
You're certain?
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
Rush her.
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
What?
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
You're precious to me, Rose.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
No, but we're making excellent time.
How cold?
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
You're welcome. Rose.
If only it were that simple.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Jack, I --
Where to, Miss?
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
I'm not going without you.
It's so cold.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
April 14, 1912.
Would you like anything?
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Well--shall we go into dinner?
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Good afternoon--
We'll save you a place at our table.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
You'll excuse me. 
Where'd you get it?
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
Tell me.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Not a chance.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
No, sir?
Change?
Are you screwy?
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Say--wait a minute!
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
That goes two ways.
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
She did?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Knots!
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Is this your gun?
Like it?
No--not much--excepting-- 
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Well, let's hear the poem--
Very good, Mary--
I'm getting seasick--
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
How much did you lose?
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
You leave the kid alone.
Congratulations.
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
Sure, Sis.
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
Isn't that a daisy?
Oh, my God...
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
On three?  You call it.
How you feeling, Doc?
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Ignore her?
Satisfied?
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
That was lovely!
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Doesn't suit you.
What's wrong?
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
No really, I can stay a while.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
Well hello, Sherm.
That what you got me up here for?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
Forget it, Ringo.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
I just got it fixed.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Look pretty rough.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
- Instant melt-down.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Is that any way to say hello?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
Fishing?
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
Something with an engine? Not oars?
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Where to now, Jimbo?
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Do I have to do everything around here?
I hope you'll be gentle.
Blood or Dutch?
Down?
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
If not?
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
Stop it!
I am. What do you want?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Approaching the first gate.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
Yes.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
I'm worn out.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
Harry, you know everything.
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
You must have done something to her.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
You invited me.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Those boys never did have good luck.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
He is in his pigeon cage.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
What's going on?
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
Hold on, Woody!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
B-3.
Miss.  G-6.
Heh-heh.
What?
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
MOM!!  MOM!!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
You'll put your clothes here.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
She'll have to learn.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
Who's there?
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
Stop it!
I've got a present for you...
Finn ...
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
What is he planning on telling them?
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
Will we get invited to the White House?
I get A's.  All A's.
Yes, mom --
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
Arizona.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
So you pay off our customs officials?
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
So go shower already.
Yes, sir!
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
You will help me with my other problem.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
It's possible.
Noriega is a criminal.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
Oh, man --
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Like you protected Landry?
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Did you tell him?
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
Jesus.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
What's your name?
What?
No, not holding hands.
What do you want?
Yes.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
Aye.
Have you got any gear on you?
But try too hard --
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
What about The Untouchables?
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
We're two thousand short.
Are you serious?
you'll need one more hit.
How long is it?
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
What do you see as your main strengths?
Homeless people?
With a starship!
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
It could. Yes.
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Where did you get this power?
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
I have a half brother.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Spock?
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
Your vision?
No conditions.




He's not?
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I am a Starfleet Officer.
I don't understand...
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Sybok, we must find a way...
Want one?
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
If you think -
You wouldn't dare.
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
User requests are what computers are for.
Hah.
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
Thank. you, Master Control.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
Yori... hey...
Nice...
Where are you off to young lady?
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
Son of a bitch!
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Now what?
Any minute now.
No!  Never!
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Yes sir.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
They must've just missed me.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Yes.
I think so.
I don't take those assignments.
Did you pork her Harry?
Do you still love me?
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Did you read the papers yesterday?
You can trust me completely.
And you chased one?
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
What do you want me to do?
How?
Who is this woman?
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
How come?
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Is that your real name? Really?
Sure. Why not?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
How long have you worked here?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
I love Janis.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
That dazzling imagination.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
A real live pimp?
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Cancoon.
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
Can you live with it?
Live with what?
You wanna get unhaunted?
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
Is he big league?
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
What's this acting class guy's name?
In case.
Who's Sonny Chiba?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
We grew up together.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
I'm really not very -
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
What do you want from me?
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
McTeague.
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
That was very good.
Where'd he come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
But a fuckin' baggie.
Nicholson and I.
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
You do more than try.
We gotta get him outta there.
Preach on, Big D.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Wake up, Cole.
Well?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
Do you know what year it is?
1995?
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
I don't know -- I don't remember.
You... you left them a message?
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
What are you talking about???
What....???
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
You have him in restraints.
You want something?
You can't do that yourself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I said I was sorry.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
He no!
Maybe I do.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
Nothing.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
But, in particular?
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
How much time?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
You got beer?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
I just drove in this morning.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Where you headed?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I guess it must.
A medicine man?
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
Like they're made of polyester.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
You never did answer my question.
Still playing?
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
You could just leave him.
You just walk away.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
Lied?  What do you mean?
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
I wanted to talk.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
Give him the money.
He was going to--
Well, nothing.
It's . . . it's locked.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Hey!
Why would I kill her?
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
I had a problem getting my car back.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I'm not rambling.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
And what does that make you?
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
You love her, but you hate her?
Drop it, Jake.
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
Jake--
Liar.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
You're not talking sense.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
For what?
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
A hundred-forty-five really.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
What happened?
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
No police.
I said I was sorry.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
I think I've heard that before.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Christ, I don't believe this!
A lot that means.
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
Bobby Cooper.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
I was hoping we could talk.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
It's the truth, Jake.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
How old are you?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You believe that?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
You could leave him.
You'd never understand.
What do you mean?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
I'm not sailing his boat.
Why?
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
<u>Jake</u>...
Where ya goin'?
I need a ticket.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
One way.
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
Morning Grace.
Yes?
Once again please?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Yes.
What about the game?
I assumed because of the train.
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
I'm going to go in.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
I mean if you knew karate?
In the passenger car?
Why?
Well, go get it then.
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
You told them cowboys you had it.
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Oh. Yeah.
You want... a free one.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Uh... a little, maybe.
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
He said that, huh?
Well, how about it?
About what?
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Been gone near three years now.
Three ways, I figured.
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Did you kill him?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
She gave me the evil eye.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
He hit you?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
That fella come by... Tom.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
What?
Say, Ned... ?
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
How many you killed, Kid?
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
What was the money for?
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
That's enough, Edie.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
You are a criminal.
What are we gonna do?
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
You watch your mouth.
I was out of line.
The answer is no.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
Waste of time.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
Wait a minute.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
Edie.
You think he's..?
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
Gruber...
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
I am seventy-four years old.
Mr. Concannon...?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That's not my handwriting.
What is this going to cost?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
That's what I'd planned to...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Yes.
Nothing happened.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I need an extension for my case.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
That happens.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
Listen to me, fella...
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Mr. Alito, please.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Why?
The TV didn't work.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
You're going to stay here...?
Is there going to be a later...?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
It's over!
What is that to you...?
Thank you.
What do you want?
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
Would you like a drink now?
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
Ernie's.
There are things you didn't tell me.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
I -- I --
Hello.
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
But you haven't lived here long.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Tomorrow night? Well --
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Why?!
I like that one.
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
I don't like it!
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Ah, no!
Yes.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
Take me away...
Yes!
I made it.
Why am I here? What happened?
No...
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
Where are you now?
Where were you born?
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
No, I can't tell you!
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
Yes --
Tell me.
Go on.
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Why?
Where?
Yes... you run this hotel.
How long has she had the room?
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
Her car is gone.
Why?
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
It's where you belong.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
What.
Johnny!
Yeah.
For what?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Just wander.
Where?
Did you need it?
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Well...
The stripper's here.
What did you say?
Why was the floor wet?
Why?
The hell you do.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
Go home!
What are you talking about?
What do you think you are doing?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Stop it!
Sun rises at 5:52.
We have to get going.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
Don't snap at them!
Later.
That's one idea.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
I want you to hear me out.
Yup.
What's your fucking point?
He just had two.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
What kind of words?
Boyd...What have we done?
I just want to get married.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
Yeah.
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
Not a prayer.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
And what happens when you can't?
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
Yup.
Why did you forget the tent check?
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
Don't you dare.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
Are we going to do this again?
I wouldn't know.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Honey I don't have the time...
I'll call them from the road.
Do you love me?
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Do you love me?
Not yet.
Hello.
Okay.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Yeah. You.
No.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Don't even.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
So what do we do?
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
You're not breathing right?
I'm getting married...
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
A move?
Greenpeace.
Did he try to kiss you?
A mutant species.
Fucking desert.
Shut up Micheal.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I'll come to you tonight.
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
You must think I'm mad.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
Is it all right?
How much is that?
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
Very, very?
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
Don't talk like that!
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
Today, a good girl.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
I don't know.
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
On my life, I promise you I will.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Think you can do it?
What happens if I can't catch him?
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
I haven't been working on anything.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
I wonder how that...
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
You catching my drift?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
What happened when he was 17?
What are you doing?
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
What does that mean?
Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
You're not capable of it.
There you go  best seat in the house.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
It's the White House.
What about it?
It's <u>producing</u>.
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
What can it hurt.
Mr. President, this is St...
...twelve years.
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
Don't you want to know if it's true?
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
<u>Do</u> it...
Tell me again.
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
...the... 
Who's gonna tell'em.
Why?
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Why?
Why is this putz on the air...
And carrying.  The National Flower of Albania, something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some <u>Harvest</u> Festival, something...
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
"...where's my pill..."
But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now: How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued that group? 
YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
Why do they go to War?
It can be documented that he displayed the...
China.
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
Is that true?
"Freedom."
You can't have a war without an enemy.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
Uh huh...why?
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
It's too clean.
Bunny:  I had an idea:  a Slinky, that falls <u>Up</u>...  Naa, we can figure that <u>out</u>.  What I'm wondering:  what do we <u>call</u> it...  You got my number... 
Black...
Yes.
The hats.
With their berets...
Long's you git me back for the beans...
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
Hey the door was open.
Then get out and close it behind you.
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
Start unloading.
Sell?
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
Another cup of coffee?
What are you doing here?
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
So, where are we going?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
So what's the problem?
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
You could have a great beach house for that.
I gather you're a decorator.
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
And what do you want?
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
What's that?
Hmm.
Thank you Jenkins
Thank you
And uh, your nicotine sir
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
Oh that explains everything.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
No thank you sir we're fine.
Can this be stopped?
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
That was very good.
I didn't want to come.
Then why did you?
These are good.
How do you know it's a she?
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
When...when will she be back?
What?  What are you afraid of?
That's not...It's not like that.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
And then you weren't there.
Thank you.
Love.
Um...sure.
Yeah.
You look a little old for a student.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
What is it?
Kambucha mushroom tea...
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
Absolutely.
Know what I think?
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
What?
Oh God...you knew.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
I don't know...
Don't.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
I know.
Oh.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
You're not at the center.
Sweetheart--
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
...I'm positive this time...
Ow!
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
She's gone.
What?
The leaves...
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
Nothing.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
Then you wear it.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
There is no one here but the dead.
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
The one time I want it to work...
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
And whose houses do you design...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Doctor's orders- - -?
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
A bit much.    Lucas.
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
You really love this guy...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
The one on the left - definitely...
BRIAN...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
All the time?
No - not all the time - I mean
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
This must be one of the old keys -
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
I lost the touch
I don't know
No she didn't...
What did you do with her?
I don't know...
Yes...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
Where are you going?
We've got nothing to talk about
I don't like sugar
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
Don't you want me now LESLIE
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
You and your pep talks.
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
Check this out.  Hurry!
What is it now?
Dead?
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
What gives, Don Corleone?
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
Well?
I mean, what do you think?
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
You do know how to drive?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
That's me.
Who exactly ARE you?
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
James, what are you doing here?
Most places are, Jimmy.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Where are we going?
Whatever.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
He phoned it in.
I see.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
I'm trembling with excitement.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
I'm very aural.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Well? Surprised?
You promise you'll finish school?
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
You called the cops on us?
You do like girls, don't you?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
I do?
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
I told you you could do it.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
You look pretty.
Merritt, Forensics.
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Did you try to fight him?
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
About a year ago.
The teeth, were they...
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
Excuse me?
Hi, Mon.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Kelly.  What is it?
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
Do it to ourselves?
Why can't you come...
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
You think that's wise?
But check this...
Forget it.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
No.
Get away from me.
I had to go look for this coupon.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Jesus, man... You okay?
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
How...
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Didn't you see her this morning?
J. S. Bach.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
What was all that back there?
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Can you fill me in here?
Thank you.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
It's not a guy...
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
It was in your book.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Nicely said, sir.
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
You're not that big.
I've even printed my own currency.
The first.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
They look like acorns.
Not today, Willow.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
I do what I'm told.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
We're a tiny version of all that?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Smells like a battle.
You hear trouble.
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
Dada, what's a daikini?
What do you want!
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
I'm all finished.  Now what?
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Oooh, this smells terrible.
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
Are you sure?
Get back here, Rool!
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Talk!  Say something!
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
Are they going to kill you?
What have you got?
You know who?
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Now what's the problem?
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
Home.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Two days.
Tell him his tea stinks.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Hochmut?
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
When will you be going?
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
She say where he is?
They are English. They don't understand.
Aunt Em!
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
No --
To see?
I don't believe you!
...didn't you?
Ahh!  Ah!
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
That's our farm!
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh - I'll get it!
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
But why?  Why?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Did I scare you?
They would?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
...ting the ruby slippers?
Ah --
Dorothy next!
I -- Oh --
Yeah. Me?
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
Quiet!
Let's.
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
...to Dorothy!
Oh --
You new?
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
He is an impostor.  Theres no Davidov at Miratom.
They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Nuclear.
I love Christmas in Turkey.
Its just a scratch.
Perhaps after this ... test?
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Ill send someone out.
Someone will come.
He was a...good lover?
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
The parcels in the post.
The bearer of bad news.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Old?
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Dan -- what do we do now?
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
I don't know their real names.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
Jon??  You mean he's --
Ever see one of these before?
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
How will you fix it?
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
What do you get if you finish?
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
Mind your business.
I was invited. What's your story?
Who are you?
I'm from L.A.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
Are you alright?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
Nothing. He had two days.
What are you doing?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
Alright, so I'll get more.
Dude, what are you doing here?
Sorry, "dude".
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
That's the guy.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
We all do.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
What are you talking about?
What's that?
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
How long have you been in Alaska?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Come with me and I'll let her live.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
If she held on any longer she could have.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
You have your tickets?
Yes, don't worry.
Very....very!
What a strange fellow.
I suppose you're right.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
I beg your pardon?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
Aye-gor!
What?
What?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
It's always been one of my favorite names.
But you did -- I just heard it.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
Yes, Master!
All right -- where is she?
That sound good, boss.
Is everything ready?
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Inga, wake up!
It looks that way.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
MMMMmmmmm!
His what??
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Three minutes to go!
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
Which one?
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river

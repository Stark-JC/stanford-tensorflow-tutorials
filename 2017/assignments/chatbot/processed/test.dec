That's a shame.
Where?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
You always been this selfish?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I did.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Can we go now?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
I just wanted --
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
The prom?  Kat has a date?
So they tell me...
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
You get the girl.
Fine, thirty.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
No fear.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
You -- covered in my vomit.

You know who The Raincoats are?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Just let me sit down.
What?
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Acting the way we do.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
For. . . ?
No.
It wasn't like that.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Just for now.
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
With the teeth of your zipper?
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
This time with me!
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Call them.
Look out of that window.
All of them created by people like me.
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
That's what it says.
Father Marchena!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Thank you.
My horse doesn't work.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
What's your cut?  How much?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Divorced.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Yeah.  This way.
No.
No.
I know.
In the kitchen.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Describe him.
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Mind if I ride along with you?
My point exactly.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
What's your accomplishment.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright.
Hey.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
You're not so bad yourself.
Could be Leon's.
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
Don't be late.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Get down on your knees.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Surprise!  Surprise!
A job?
What are you doing here?
In love?  With who?
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
What are you coming here to do?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Oh yeah, why?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Not good.
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
She's wonderful.
Right. Just a sec.
It's possible.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Goodbye, Daddy.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Certainly.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Roger.
Hammond.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Goodbye.
What's the matter with my place?
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
You're done.  End of story.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
He's after your money.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
What about Ganz?
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
I lost them, that's what happened.
You couldn't get to him?
I didn't have the time.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
That's the way I see it, too.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
How would you know?
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Napoleon... small.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
You know exactly where they are!
No thank you.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
I didn't know your size.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Vito Cornelius?
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
...Not yet.
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Where have I heard this song before?
You're the only one left alive...
Three of us will never fit in there!
Uh...
You get that off the screen?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I'm so tired...
I want to sleep... forever...
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
How much time is left?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
I love you.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
Why the gun?
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
You couldn't?
Tom... she's dead.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
I'm camera shy.
They should be here any minute.
Look, I don't know what this...
Any good?
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Tell me what happened.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
I'm asking.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Sounds good, pops.
Interesting theory.
Child pornography.
Where does he sell it?
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
It's their Presidential Suite.
My condolences.
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
I'm afraid I don't...
This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
No.
I'm not positive this means anything.
The checks were for odd amounts...
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
You told me to look, so I looked.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
No.
Why do you think he did it?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I had to ask.  I apologize.
We're all like that.
You should be.
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know.  I think so.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
What... ?
Her belongings?
Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Cash.
What?
What?
Then we'll stay up together.
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
I know.  Uh...Alice.
Three days.
It was Freddy.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Oh God!  He killed them!
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
Huh?
Who said I...wait, what?
You're right.
Me too.
Had kind of a long night.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
He invited me to his house last night.
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
Helen.  I appeal to you -
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
Oh it does???
The frogmen?
We hope!
Wonderful!
Anything ---
There's got to be an explanation!
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
What?
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Always has been.
Same old shit.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Guaranteed, eh?
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Yeah?
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Yeah.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
In the chest.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Yeah. It's stupid.
What are you talking about?
I just think you used to be bad.
Jesus, why?
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
Yes.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
It's pretty old.
I want to go home.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Fuck you.
Huh?
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Like hell.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
You? Why?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
See. Get your boots.
Mel Gordon.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
You knew me as a kid.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Think they're alright?
There's a furnace.
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
Atta-go.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Who?
You think Jack shot him?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Lemme take a look.
We don't know that.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
To swear you in as President.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
A secret service agent. It must be.
We're not going to make it.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
How can you? I mean they're people.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
Gravity.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
The fax machines.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Commissioner.
I just wish it was that simple.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
What's the story?
What is it, Mary?
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Dunn.
You better take this.
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Ted!
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
Roger.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
That's not possible.
Go ahead.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Can I hold him?
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
All right.  Here.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
I'm sure.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
A b...
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Ted!
I love you.
Headquarters!? What is it?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Good-bye, darling.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Here.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Do it!
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Yes.
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
At the end of the bar.
This is mole.  It's good.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
Please, I must get out here.
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
We all did.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
But there's no more drug.
Sure.  Just a minute.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll bet.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Talk to me, Hudson.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
Forget it.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
No.  Have you?
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Why not?
You promise?
I'm sorry, Newt.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Where?
I'm so relieved.
What??
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Now?
Fartsbishop!
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Eat my - ah!
Of course.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Give me two more weeks. Please.
He's terribly busy, sir.
Really?
Then he didn't send you?
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
What for?
What do you mean?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
And German?
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Thank you, Sire!
Yes, Sire.
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
How many?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Why? What has happened?
Sssh! Stay here.
I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
German!
So there you are. What do you say?
Yes.
What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Ah!
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
You burned the score?
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
A Mass for the dead.
What dead? Who is dead?
No! No, it's him!
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Please! Just one moment.
I think so.
You go fast!
Yes.
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
A little modesty would suit you better.
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I do not seek forgiveness.
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
But not his body.
I've seen the manuscript.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
Go about your duties.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
David says Jack comes to warn him.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Dr. Hirsch?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
I expect you shortly.
Tea would be nice.
It was a wolf.
Yes?
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
How is that?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
That's easy enough.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Now I'm embarrassed.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Yeah, I would think so, too.
Very nice.
Of course.
But, David.
Do me an enormous favor?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
No.
No.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Why are you doing this to me?
No, but we're about to.
What time is it?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
I really don't know.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
What was it?
A coyote.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
Will you be quiet?!
It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
What do you think?
You don't have to say anything.
If I was still alive, I probably would.
What here?
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I want to know why .
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
And tell him not to delay.
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
We'll discuss that in the board room.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
All right, Jack, all right.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Don't you know?
No.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Cyril!
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Let me see your cash book, will you?
It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Happy now?
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
All right. Send him in.
No, sir.
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
I can't tell you.
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Why?
With what?
Yes.
Well . . . ?
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
I'm okay, Matt.
You've got enough?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
You stay out of this, Bob.
What?
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
"Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
Twenty?!
What will be?
I got us through the War all right.
A trap.
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
If I could go back to farming --
No, I --
I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
What?
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
And what's this right girl like?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
Fair enough.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Not at all.
What, sir?
Oh, that's the best part.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
It's going to be a long winter.
Stop it. I'm...
Oh God, just get it over with.
Would you like to see my apartment?
Do you take American Express?
Everybody's rich.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
Are you sure?
I won't...don't worry.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
Lucky, I guess.
Patrick?
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
See you then.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Who?
Can you bring Mr...
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Forget it.
Hmmmm.
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
It's no problem
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Understandable.  Lime?
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
Your address?
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Nothing.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
So...you hang out here a lot?
What?
Well, I could he wrong.
I'll be there.
Marcus?
So who was he with?
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Shhhh...it's okay.
Oh well, you know.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
No, Owen.
"Make" him?
Didn't you visit the campus?
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
Teddy was killed last night.
It was a hate crime.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
...Different?
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
What?
That'll be a test, won't it?
I don't think he knows how.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Would you like a Coke or something?
Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
Well -- you sent for me.
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
No. Please.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
He's out of prison?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
Please don't go.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Wait a second. He knows I know.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
Oh we're not going to the campus.
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful!
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
A Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
I'm sorry.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Danger's my middle name.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
Silence!
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
Yes.
Dr. Evil?
Please allow me to demonstrate.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
What did you say?
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
How's Austin?
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
... love ...
I'm afraid that's impossible.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
You killed my husband.
Too many cooks --
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
But -- why?
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
And just what is the game?
Much better.
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Any other vices?
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
Did you say formal? I must dress.
But if someone miniaturized the process...
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Nothing personal.
You're playing games.
Winning isn't everything.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
Decontamination -- ?
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
So you say ...
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Insane ... ?
Mother and Father know best.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
What do you mean?
Yeah. What is it?
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Oh, come on, just a little.
The best.
I love that car.
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
What's the matter?
Good...
Can't I just go with you guys?
I hope those guys are all right.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
What are you...
That's more like it.
What's going on?
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Can't I just maim it a little?
You've been having strange sex...!
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
I'm separated.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
That's the old Rick!
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
In the Field Museum once.
It works.
Fuck you.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
You're back.
I work for city hall.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Well, you did invite me here.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
I was doing my job.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Yes.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
I quit two days ago, Brian.
Hey, do I know you?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
I need another one, sir.
See you Monday. Sir.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Pest control.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
What?
What reason?
Nice bunch of guys.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Then who wrote the report?
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
No.
Yeah.
You look like... Brian.
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Nice boat.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
It's not your roof anymore.
He treats you okay?
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
Alderman.
No Marty, I don't.
Investigator...
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
Who?
The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
I'm a Catholic.
I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
Yes, Sister?
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
We're starving.
You're now Mantan.
I won't do it anymore.
Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
What are there character traits?
We think so.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
Always keep 'em laughing.
Is that so?
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Do you know how you will use him?
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired. 
Which one is your brother?
I thought it was appropiate.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Light?
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Yes he did.
Where is he?
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
I just turned twenty.
Finland.
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
What do you mean?
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Not her, the one with the little...
She hates dem.
...too late, maybe around...
...perfect...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Never read a book in my whole life.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
O'Grady.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
How do you do, sir?
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
I have heard of them.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
Only the agency of servants.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
It is my only object.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
All the same, you must name an amount.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Yes!
When is he to go?
Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
May I be quite frank with you?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Can anybody hear me!
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
We found him like this...
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
You wanna bet?
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
West's. Any kindling for afire?
Do I?
If not you, then who?
Mueller.
Oh, come on --
Bullshit.
You're lying --
But not the only victim, right?
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
Then who did?
Maybe --
Tell me what I can do.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Nevertheless --
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
You knew Sergeant West?
Best time for banal chit-chat.
Something like that. You?
You're off to a late start.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
They got their stories straight.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Seven.
What if I don't want it?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
No one else heard it?
What?
Wrong answer --
Childs.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
He's not Army, it's not official --
We know.
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
That would explain the indigestion.
There's only one I want.
Not yet.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Then do it.
Fine, I'm doing it.
I brought it.
Let's see it.
Don.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
What did she look like?
I'll...
Lucky girl.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Really?
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Am I?
Did you do any of that?
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
Really.
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
'Fraid so.
Hello.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
I'll help you.
I'm going with you.
But it's romantic.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
Of course.
That's okay?
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Yeah.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
John.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
Syevodnya
I don't want to know.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
I know you just want to punish me --
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
And? What are you saying?
So now you hate all women?
I got what I paid for.
Get out
You are throwing me out.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Except for Small Eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
It's what you came back for.
No. What? No. I know.
Maybe you will find out.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
How do you want to pay?
Cash.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
You take her to a doctor?
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
What do you need?
Well, that makes it easier.
For your hands?
Yeah.
Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
Let go...
LAZ, I said let...!
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Why you got me chained?
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
I said... STOP!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
Sure.
Anything.
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
Looks like you know a song.
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.
Like I told you.
I didn't start this, R.L.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You could put it that way.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
Yeah, I know.
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Yeah.
Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
No.
In Rome, I'll bow.
Nick, we can't just --
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Hey, all right.
Connie...
Give me a break, would you?
Where would you look for the mafia?
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
I stole them.
Ichiro --
Gaiijin.
A resort city, Beppu.
Nick, you can't do this.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
How can you be so sure?
I don't give tours.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
I need someone to translate for me.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
Time, I've got plenty of.
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
What?
What...?  What if I say no?
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
You trust me?
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
Pris?
Anywhere.
Not to be trapped.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Thank you.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Go.
Why, yes, of course.
What about a summary then.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
No thanks.
Sorry.
I'm doing okay.
Let's hear it.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Who?
What night?
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
I don't know nothing about it.
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
In your opinion.
What do you want me to do?
Sit.
What's a long time?
No.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
If she is, the machine works.
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
Know what a turtle is?
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
You're all so perfect.
Yes?
Bravo!
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
For how long?
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
You're lost?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Oh, that's nice.
Again.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Heck, no!  What?!
Oh, I could die...
Thank-Q!
Sorry.
Name it.
Then forget it.
Is this your house?
Yes!
Yes!
Yeah.
Well...yeah. Okay.
Do I look crazy?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
It was at least as good as the sky.
Gee-ma-nee!
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
Yes.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
I'll try.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Uh-huh.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
I love Lucy!
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
True.
Okay.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
The sky?  Where?
I don't see anything!
Just look!!
Hi.
I'll go up.
Mom?
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
What about relatives?
No.  They all do.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
All our friends...
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
How could you?! This is just like home!
You have tranquilizers?
What?
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
If he tells, it won't come true!
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
I see "elegant."
I think...it...works.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
We did not leave together.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
What?
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
We'll find him.
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Roger, Wolf One.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
The criminals are winning.
Yes.
Yes sir. I sure am.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
I, I don't know.
You don't?
That's not crazy. I like you too.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Yes.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
No.  Hi baby.
It's okay. It's okay.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Those are my breasts.
Nothing.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Yeah, I know.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Am I bothering you?
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Maybe so.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Brilliant.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Yeah.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
I'm really sorry.
Oh yeah?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
You look beautiful.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Okay.
Dorothy Vallens?
You can change it if you want to.
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
I need Il Duce.
This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Got it.
Let's do him right here.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
We paid attention in school.
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
Fuck!
me up the...
Ass!
If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
...so that which is good may flourish
What?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
It is your corrupt we claim.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Can she I.D. them?
Three.
How do you figure?
Rocco!
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
Really want to know?
Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Shit! Shit!
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
Who were the victims?
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
We promise.
What are you serious?
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
God's permission? God doesn't...
You feel?
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
Would they do that?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Yeah, I heard that.
Hang on a second.
Just turn right here.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Where's the other stocker?
Like he meant it.
I keep it for emergencies.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
True.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
No. We didn't.
Inez, this is --
What. What's the matter?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Bob?
Don't worry about it, Bob.
This was in fourth grade.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
I'm sorry, Bob.
It's like we've finally arrived.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
So do I.
Roger.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
He did?
Yeah.
You got to be kidding me.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
You're kidding.
No. I'm not.
Scale the --
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
Take a deep breath.
It feels good.
Me?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
Death.
No. Bob did.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Is that OK?
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
No, I don't mind.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
Were you adopted, Bob?
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
True.
I don't know about that.
My brother.
Let's cut the bullshit.
You're paranoid, Bob.
I told you he's crazy.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
Let's just go.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
What the fuck possessed you?
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Look. We want you on the job.
Where's Applejack?
Here we go.
He's damn good.
We're just going over a few things.
Yes.
Why did he go that way? 
You Hoto?
No, it's not.
Good to know you, John.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Don't know.
The sooner the better.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Then what?
Is this really happening?
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
-- what? --
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
It's just a nightmare.
The Telegraph office.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There's no choice.
You do?
Yes.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
I was here!
I want to come in.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Sounds like a threat.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Is there. Is all there.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
Still...
Who's this?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Are we locked up?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
He has already agreed to come.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
I rest.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Shall I leave, M'lord?
No. He did not.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
I do not confess.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
I don't know. These things take time.
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
Where are my goddamn books?
Photos?
Like Ozzy.
Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
Duck, here they come.
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Like how?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Ha! Where's that?
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Why's that?
Different? How?
Kayleigh? What happened?
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
You're such a retard!
Yes?
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
He did. Captain Renault did.
So you decided to go to America.
Yes, Monsieur.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
I'm awfully sorry.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
What are they?
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Please.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
I don't understand. What about you?
No.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Ask me?
We all try. You succeed.
Not at all.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
I slept very well.
Good day.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
I expected no less, Captain.
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
And if it should change?
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
He'll take one.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
Go ahead, Ricky.
I think perhaps you're right.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Put it down!
-- You thought what?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
Uh, my watch stopped.
No water, no work.
Do too little you'll die.
No.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Shut up.
You are.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
Okay.  Sure.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Sure.
Cold.
I thought I did.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
For when I travel?
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
I would have done the same thing.
You have any children?
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
My epitaph.
Not when you have no choice.
You too.
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Not to mention on me.
True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
To Wilson.
Hallelujah.
Deep, real deep.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
I'm sorry, Homer.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
Really?
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
*What* will be okay?
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
That's true.
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Did you know your mother better?
What's a nanny do?
His father's dead, right?
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
Have you enlisted?
No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
No trouble.
Almost.
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
What view?
She took off in the night!
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
The standard ten.
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
Isn't it always?
And these cops? What do they get?
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
After you cut her loose.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
So we go to the bar.
Tonight. Just me.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
That's it.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
Because you killed one of my crew.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
No thanks. I'm good.
Great. Thank you.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Help me.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
You're just going to have to trust me.
I don't trust anyone.
Then show me how.
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
Good point.
You going to have the time?
Of what? They're both crooks.
Keep it up.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Sorry. What?
Pretty much.
I try.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
It's the tension.
I despise the job.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
Sorry.
A couple I know are getting married.
How about five hundred.
I'm working on that soccer story.
I won't be that long.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
I'll see you in my dreams.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Marion, stop this.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
I hope it brings you luck.
It will.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
You were talking in your sleep.
Never. Why do you ask?
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
There's a casino in this hotel.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
I owe a lot of money.
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Did you solve your problems?
And what do you do, Lucy?
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
Rough life, Jack.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
Give me 365.
We do. 
Five.
Does he win?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Right, that checks out here.
Look, bomb...
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
To explode, of course.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
I'll check it.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Any planets?
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Not now!
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
This.
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Where?
You're not still pissed?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
I got overhead...
SHHH!  Don't do that!
They took my daughter.
I know.
Can you help me get her back?
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
No...
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
When?
Girl's gotta make a living.
Thank God.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Who is...
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Something.
I'm not a half bad cook.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
Yes on all counts.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
Somebody's got to.
And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.
A friend of your fiance's.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
I just don't go in with any expectations.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
A little what?
You know what I'm saying.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
And because he's my friend.
They're prisoners to their genes.
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
What if he's on the level?
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
I'm the victim here.
Really?
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
A toy?
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
Huh?
Who's Whiskey Dick?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Thanks.
Yeah?
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
It's not nearly enough, punk.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Yeah, you did!
What happened?
A metal craft of any kind.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
I am so sorry.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
I'm going home.
Are you okay?
Hey. You OK?
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
When did you stop taking your medication?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I don't own a television.
No.  That's stupid.
What is her name?
Do you think a lot about girls?
A sign from whom?
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
What did you want for Christmas that year?
I have the power to build a time machine.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
I guess they made him do it.
Oh God, I'm dead...
Really?
Airport Ho-Jo!
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
C'mere. I love you so much.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Bitch!
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Hi.
Loretta, shut it.
You don't know where this is gonna...
I got a hairdo.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
That's right.
Okay?
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
The king can do to wrong! 
Who to?
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
"My dear President"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
What's the matter with you?
What do you whistle?
I don't want him.
Did you shoot the rapids?
I don't wanna work at all.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
She did.
What did you say to her?
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
And Vera niece, too.
What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
Give me that again!
You upstart!
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
Your Excellency!
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Oh, would you...?
Yes please, two.
How lovely.
I'll join you shortly.
No, I think a whiskey.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Yes.
Say "Merrick".
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!
The hospital?
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
How is your tea, John?
Not at all, John.
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
No, John, not one that I can see.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
Yes! The workhouse!
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
HE'S GONE!
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
But, Father, it IS!
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Yes.
"The fifth one this week"!
You're as bad as my father.
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
What d'you mean?
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
Yes?
Don't talk nonsense.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
Sh!
Oh, get it over with.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
It saved my father!
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
What?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
You may need a real Berserk.
The sun! That's it!
Look out!
Now stop it!
No! Arrgh!
What is it?
I was sitting there.
Please.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Your lord.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
I... I...
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Well... I... I thought...
You fool!
So did my father and his father before him.
Dad!
Yes, Mother.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Here we are.
In the world.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Why?
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Very much.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
I'm fine.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
No, not at all.
You'll call me, right?
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
I did it. I guess that means something.
Hi.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Okay.
Oh.
Female.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
That's okay. I --
I'm nervous, too.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
It's too late.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Hi.
How was it?
In a minute.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
That's a good one.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
What?
I swear.
Then why did you ask me?
Thanks.
How do you mean?
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I have a family, Mary.
He went home sick.
Oh dear.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
So now you're bummin' around?
I'm the best.
Your ranch?
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Hold on, Coop...
On my way.
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
What happened?
His peritoneum has ruptured...
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
Thank you.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
Justin. I won't let you die.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
Do it.
Justin.
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
The date.
Yes...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
Where has it been for the past seven years?
Better if I just show you.
Love to.
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Now what?
Come again, Skipper?
One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Five seconds.
Blow it up?
Yes.
He's been past Mars?
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
She's not ugly.
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Do they have pressure?
It means nothing.
I mean...
What did he do to the uniform?!
I'm worried about you.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
What is this? Where's Reed?
I already got it. Everything I want.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Youthful high spirits.
I had it at four.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
We're working as hard as we can --
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Oh, it is.
They're not costumes.
Blockhead started it!
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Showtime.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Great minds think alike.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
What...?  Oh.
What in the world would give me that idea?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
You want to work at Carl's?
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Sis.
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Why?
Okay, Dennis.
You're fired.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Hello.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Damone! You come here?
Really.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
I don't go at all.
He is.
This ain't no cop.
Do you think that guy's cute?
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Believe it.
I know.
There's nothing to it.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
Yeah, like maybe never.
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Dartmouth?!
What class?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
The point sounds fine.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
I've heard that, too.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Well... it's getting kind of late.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Oh. I see.
Anything to drink?
Okay. Thanks.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Jesus! Did I say that?
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
That's what gives me The Fear.
I want to leave fast.
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
What limes?
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.
Us?
Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
...and every one of them stacked naked...
They were all veterans.
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
I fear nothing.
That's a strange attitude.
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Where is everyone?
Anyone.
You gotta be with me on this.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Anyone else?
Anybody else?
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
What's going on between you two?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
What the hell's going on here!?
Gimme the keys.
If he doesn't shut up...
Nothing, just lookin'.
That's one piece of four problems.
Deal.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
I'd like nothing better.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Who is she?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
A rich actress.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Right now we have to be practical.
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Sort of.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
I know.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
But, Kurt, I...
Why?
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Well? What'd you think?
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
No, they don't, do they?
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
I guess.
Oh Harry...
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Why do you say that?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
But I want to. I'm trying!
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
You're taking me home!
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
Sure.
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
I don't believe so.
I see.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
I'll have someone show you to your room.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
You what?
I was watching.
Yes. Very close
Kill me and have done with it.
Her body pleases me.
It's been months. It's not like him.
It's far too late for him to still be out.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
Not as weak as I.
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Aye, Captain.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
I know. You have a way of making an impression.
Quite a few.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
No. He had more important work.
How much longer?
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
For what?
Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
I heard.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Okay.
Marcie?
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
I can't, Barry...
Somebody'll see.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Let's go back, Barry...
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
A short somewhere.
I'll spot you five points.
I don't believe you...
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
I love you.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
How much do I owe you?
Yeah.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
In heaven.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Real McCoy.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
He backed down.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
What do you think Mom would say?
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
Yeah, we got a bible.
I'm really sorry.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
I wasn't scratching!
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
He signaled the Ranger.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
One... Two... Three.
What?
That's what you look like.
You're lookin' green.
I'm here with you.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Who's...  Lieuten --
What'd you find, Kathy?
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Standing right here in my office.
Really, I have no problem with --
Oh, really.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Sir?  What did he say?
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Did you hear?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Yes, dear.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Sir?
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane."  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Which is guy-speak for...
Made it to Week 10 last time.
He was married?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I think you look beautiful.
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
Just askin'
You heard me.  Move on.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Your new roommate.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
We are so fucked.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
I don't know.  Seems...
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Nearly four years...
You made a mistake.
Only one way to find out.
It's good to see you, Nick.
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Speak of the devil.
It's your choice.
Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
That is when we will go in.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
You don't have the authority to do that.
We know.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
It's Raymond.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
Must be some sort of mining facility.
Shut up.
The guy is terminally selfish!
A boy comes to the door.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
Down there.
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
Wait two seconds then go.
GO Commander.
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
The enemy is matching velocity.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
All right. Put me back on with him.
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
I think he just likes pointing at things.
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
... Maintenance facility...
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
Practice driving, Tommy.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Get oacK on their tail.
I wish she was beneath me.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Yes, general?
You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work.  You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want...
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
No one knows...
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
You invented this, this...
General Lee is detained captain...
Unofficially, General Greene.
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
Surely you knew this was coming.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Our 'kind'?  What is that supposed to mean?  These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight!  They desire it!  They seek it!  Of course Virginia is terrified!  For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!?  It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own this country too!
I want you to see our hospital.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
You're kidding me, right?
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
So where's the money?
I mean I don't care.
No. What's this?
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
He's around someplace.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
What money?
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Sovereign.
Not yet. I just started.
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
He drown?
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
Who?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
One of mine?
Buddy?
What's that?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
It's all mine.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
You broke in?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
That's right. Three percent.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Then you've read it?
Sounds fair.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
And you think the movie business is any different?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
Are you going down?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
How honorable of you.
I'm going.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
What? You sure?
Lemme see.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
What is it?
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Like I always say --
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long?
Goddamit, Dodge.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Don't lie to me!
If money can buy what he wants.
Right.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
That's what I call a payday.
You're a pal.
Because of the gold.
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
Nope.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
Greer?
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
That much I think we've already established.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
Over the gold.
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
Sorry.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Guess.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
What are you trying to say?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
Uh-oh.
It's not optional!
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
You need counseling.
Yeah, well... hi...
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Hey Josh.
Just look at them!
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
That lets us off the hook.
You can have that one.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
Oh, we totally have to.
What is this?
Oh yeah.
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
JOSH!
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
Anthony's II!
No way... when?
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
No, really...
God, you're really obsessed...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
Nothing.
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
I said "great"...
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
I dunno...
Maybe an orange juice.
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
It's kind of falling apart.
Did you bring that tape?
Hey, where are you going?
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Really? Can I see it?
I'm totally serious!
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
I - I'd really rather not...
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
No, Doofus... blow it out!
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Really?
Never...
YAAA!
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
...I better not...
Well when can we do something?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
Do you have anything to drink?
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
I-I-I...
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
They're Seymour's.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
She's not at home?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
What are you talking about?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Don't they, though?
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
You never had it.
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Have you got that in writing? 
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
Somehow I guessed. 
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
...don't know...
Don't they have to be?...
Good luck.
Because I think they're after you.
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
Everybody has a choice.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
How is he these days?
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
Okay, let's take a look.
Oh, hello, Peter.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
I don't know what to do anymore.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
Does she know anything about babies?
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
Command me, lord.
I command you.
Maybe they just want to appeal.
Did I forget something?
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
And we're the ...
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who, Ray?
I hate Jello.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
So we'll put a warning on the label.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
No.  They're just coming to me.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
No?  What do I act like?
On a purely scientific basis.
Who's the stiff?
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Whoa!! Nice voice.
Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Is that a game?
Has this ever happened before?
Did you ever report it to anyone?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
Good guess -- but no.
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
What have you got, Egon?
I'm always serious.
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Why not?
She said he was "the Destructor."
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
I want that bastard dead!
Gladly Caesar.
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
Until your confirmation date.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
Why you?
My loyalties... were in doubt.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
He killed his father and then my family...
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
Quintus is overly idealistic.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
You teach them!
Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
No.
I think I'd better go home now please.
I'm glad.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
That woman --
At the Zoo.
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
I don't understand.
Goodbye.
I don't know.
But you might.
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
I have to go back now.
I just don't think it would...
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Oh -- no sir.
Who screamed?
Could I make one phone call first?
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Did you get a room?
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
No. 
But it's light in there now.
Please.
No.
I'm very neurotic.
What do you mean?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
What?
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
It's all right.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
I know that. But I'm --
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Do you understand what I said?
Yes.
I haven't. No.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Okay.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
You can admit that, can't you?
Wait a minute!
Anything. Anything at all.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Go ahead then.
I don't.
There's no risk?
You walk right out the door.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
We're talking.
Right.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
I don't.
No.
Well I can't.
Don't tell Elaine.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
Why not?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
I was just kidding around.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
Are you?
Thank you.  Benjamin --
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Go home now.
I'll find her.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
What about it?
Different.
Yes, sir.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Quite a while.
Thank you.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
I will.
Yes.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Benjamin Braddock.
Dad -- can you listen --
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
I don't believe it.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
The pearls are in her room.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
What about the money?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
What?
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Really?
Chasing what?
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Anything for you.
You live here?
Because you love me -- you love me?
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
And then --?
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Strange man...
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
No.
Really?
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
And what do you do -- now?
I know.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
Why do you think --
Till then.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
We could come to my room.
No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Yes, I was in the war.
As you will.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Good heavens. What for?
Most imposters are --
This gentleman can have my room.
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
Oh, don't go.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
You don't understand that do you?
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
What?
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
I got ten marks for that.
What?
What?
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
Oh!
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end. 
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
I could not think of not accepting.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
What do you want with her?
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
No.
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
You know it, Lilly.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Fine.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
What is?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
Only one tooth?
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
No. And you have to be.
That's right.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
At what?
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
NO!
Joe, you know you'll --
In your other hand.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
See you soon.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
Is that right?
And when he got serious?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
I thought these people were broke.
What?  What for?
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
She didn't see you, in other words.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
Maybe I like it where I am.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Not many.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Only the real stiffs.
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
My god...
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Checking out your place.
Nothing's missing?
My life is a living hell.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I was trying to protect you from this...
I don't know.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
I borrowed it.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Here, take my jacket.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Michael Meyers!
You're right.  It does sound strange.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
We can light our own tree at home.
Guess so ...
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
You stay away from him!
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Why did you take Jamie?
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
Um.
I suppose.
You know what gets me?
Tell them yourself!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
You told me.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Me?
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Hello.
Are you--
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
It makes life spicy.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Tell me that.
Mhravitch.
Sir?
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
What's this?
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
No.
Open the bolt!
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Please--
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
It's so--so stark.
We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Which one?
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
What then?
That's what you're supposed to say.
It couldn't!
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Such as?...
And what is his most cherished possession?
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
Why not?
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
No you don't.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
You've been bitten by bats?
Would you say that again?
You were wrong, you quack!
There's a certain amount of information there.
We'll find out now, won't we?
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
Poison.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
It was a bitch.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
What will you do, Colonel?
Won't you please join our club? Please?
I don't care what she wears.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
That's an interesting piece of news.
Not true.
Then who flushed the toilet?
Then get him.
Okay.
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
He is my father.
I'm glad.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
A what?
What was it?
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
How long has this been going on?
Tonight's the night.
Why would you do that?
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
It's good.  Let him go.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
But is she, has...
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
Do you want to take a session?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Okay.
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
You're not a film producer, are you?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
Of Joanne's?
'Sucking off.'
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Is that the way it was with you?
How important do you think sex is?
We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.
No, please go on.
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Granville?
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
What have you found out?
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
No.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Hmm.
I don't know.
What's it called?
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
You're talking about real excitement?
Take it or leave it.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
Who?
It's a short film.
I don't know nothing, man.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
What do you think of that? Or this?
Oh.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
Who's that?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Thanks.
Yes, I am.
Hello.
No.
Lady! Be quiet.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Well then.
Eh, fine.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
That's really great.
No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
Yes. It's almost there.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Maude, do you pray?
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Maude.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Farewell?
No. My uncle.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
No.
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
I go to funerals.
No.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
ZAT!
Oh sure.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Well, I don't...
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Yes.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
We have no more surprises.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
And what about you?
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Yeah.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
See? I don't like that --
-- Hound of resurrection?
No. It's not.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
Did he, now?
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
I won't take 'em. They never work.
No. Don't --
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
Not hungry.
Goodnight.
My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
My fucking hand!
Want to buy a bed?
We're leaving.
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Her mother's dead.
Who are you?
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
That's right. Who are you?
I'm very happy.
Sure you are.
Who are you?
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
You're hurting.
A box?
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You're still afraid.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
I don't.
Maybe.
There's very little I can do about it.
I need a skin. Then we leave --
What's the problem?
It's just been empty a while.
No. I'm not.
So what's the argument?
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
Are you O.K.?
Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
O.K.
What's wrong with you?
It's better you see for yourself --
Drinking alone.
Just soda.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
I... suppose so, yes.
That's more like it.
YOU'D like my room.
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
Take care, Dad.
Sure.
You don't like her at all do you?
I don't believe it.
No you don't.
I have to get out.
If there's a train.
I see.
Meaning what?
I've been better.
Oh, so what's the point then?
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
What do you mean, "what?"
What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
My band.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
What?
So?  You even said they're good.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
I have a television.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Why?
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Oh.  Okay.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Is there a difference?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Fine.  That's great.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
But don't you remember?
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
What's the obvious stuff?
What, what?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
I don't know.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Great... That's great.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I'm not -- hold on...
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
You know I'm a good person.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
I guess I am.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
Do you want me to be there?
Mmnn.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Okay.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Harder.
How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
We took care of that.
I mean it.
Not in love, exactly, but...
I don't know.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
That way.
I'll call you.
How's the store?
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Yeah.
Sure.
Go to hell.
Happy birthday.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Basil the II.
Grave robbers?
Dupont Circle.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
Are you?
No.  I had to talk to you.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
At least.
That's impossible.
A factor of age.
He knows about you.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
Not power.  Not control.
You're never "just curious".  You've met my neice, Brenna.
Thanks.
Call your mother.  You never call her.
What do you want from me?
Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town.  And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons.
Four?
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
I want Taupin.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
What's all of this got to do with me?
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Aye.
You're not from these parts.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
But you lived.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
You feel you know me.
Not even a single lifetime.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
Again.  Try again.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
Who?
You're wrong.
Don't threaten me, Private.
I had no choice.
Thanks.
Where did you learn that?
Head still secure to the neck.
-Since you last saw me.
Not so long.
Leave her out of this.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
What are you getting at?
Where were you Tuesday night?
Home.
The resemblance is amazing.
Hildy!
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
But --
Did you finish the interview?
Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Oh.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Thanks a lot.
So long.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?
Hello, Hildy!
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
What's his line?
He's in the insurance business.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Thanks...
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
What tricks would I pull?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
I get it!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Yes.
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Sure.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
I'm busy, Duffy.
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
They're always after me for interviews.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Call you back.
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Good coffee, isn't it?
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Not this gun!
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
Editorials?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
And up a dime.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
I thought so, too.
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Put down that gun, Earl.
Don't move!
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Get the Governor on the phone!
No, I don't think so.
For heaven's sake, why not?
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
You can't bribe me!
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
Who told you that?
Sod.
Could.
We thought it was poison.
...and six...
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
Propaganda. We've been had.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
And the bride.
Oh, that.
Jam.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
Fair enough.  The river.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Huh... what cone?
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
Well, yeah, kind of.
Now, what makes you think that?
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Perfect.
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
Way out here?
Cat fight, cat fight.
You're a real fucking piece of work.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
What I need are some answers. 
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
What?
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Recover any bodies?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
Fit the profile?
Shhhh... you hear that?
Dr. Satan?
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
You are sweet.
Very well.
Stop. Get away.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
I just want to talk.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
No!
Oui.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Always. Ow.
And I think I'm going to.
Oh, Rosie.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
I'm not sure.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
I'm sorry?
No biggie.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Yes, and...
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
Yes, darling.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
You are an animal.
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!
Such as what womanly things?
Oh boy!
Thank you very much for that.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Lila...
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
No.
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Check!
You look different... More relaxed.
I've never been to Louisville.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
You tell me.
Thank you.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Sit down.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Man named Turk Baker?
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
Come on, let's go...
Where?
How much?
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
It's a long walk.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Who's he?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Why?
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Fast and loose, man.
Eddie...
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
Give me a drink, will ya?
Go to hell.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
Talk to me, Charlie.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Aw, Eddie.
What for? To play Fats again?
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Okay?
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Half and a dollar.
Call it.
What bus?
Yours.
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
Do you always ask so many questions?
I could always get us a bottle.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Come here.
Mm hmm.
I'm getting treatments right here.
No, why should I? It's yours.
Give it back to me.
Is he a winner?
Oh, I don't know.
Come here. Come on, now.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Shut up.
That's right.
Hundred dollars?
Nine ball.  Three ball.
That's what the game's all about.
Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
Game's over, Eddie.
Thousand dollars a game.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
No.
With them?
Yes.
What?
I only protect myself -- !
You know what I mean.
Humans.
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
What?
Round back.
That's the Air Force Base.
There's Cassius ...
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
I was so scared.
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
The State Police.
I know a way.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
A toast to the end of the world.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
More than likely.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
What're you talking about?
Haven't you been watching?
Not really...
I'm thinking.
You still got the Olds?
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Be careful.
Dick-weed.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
So push it!
It's all fuzzy.
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
That'd be cool!
Yes.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
All my life!
Dad was onto something here!
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
An old man's dream.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
In that case, I permit you.
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Lower me down.
I said don't go between them!
What were they looking for?
You had it? You didn't trust me!
So it did.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
If only I could have been with you.
I came here to save you.
Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
Brody's this way.
Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
Good.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
What did you find, Dad?
A long time to wait.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
Who are you?
My name is Kazim.
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
There are no stories anymore.
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
Nee chin lie how ma?
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
You will go to palace there.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
A snake!
First of all -- don't panic!
Just one arm!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
You're talking to an authority in that area.
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
I want to go home...
Try me.
Yes.
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
Then what are you stopping for?
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
I am. You are.
I'm not gonna make it easy.
Good. Get to a phone.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
The beach.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
You eat it.
Eat it.
What was?
A girl.
What?
Rene...
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
It wasn't like that.
Just stay here and rest.

GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
Where've you been?
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
That's nice.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
It's all we've got.
It'll remind me of you.
Let us get to the border!
Me.
Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.
Sir?
It's just money.
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
It is to me too.
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
What things?
Who...are you?
Thanks.
What?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
...I'm looking for someone.
No. No one to speak of.
Without what?
I waited for you.
I am sort of scattered.
And how'm I doing?
...Naw. Made that up.
How often they come here?
Why?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
What's he done?
We're very close.
What?
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
I can't fly it.
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
If he was able, what would he say.
Why'd you invite me here?
I don't know.
You can't take that.
It will.
Hi, Daddy.
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in."  ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you?
Three hours.
Sure. Where?
Monday.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
I'm not touching my film...
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
No, no, we're fine...
Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
You're sure you want to do this?
Yes, it's on the stove...
What do you need at the store?
Right now?
I don't understand.
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
That's for food.
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
I'm alone on this...
Oh, baby...
I'll call you then.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
You eating with us?
What's this?
Who are these people?
Good.
Alright. What did you think?
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
Everything interests me.
How have you liked your stay?
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
You okay?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
What do you mean there is no family?
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
It acts as a...
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
You threatening my family, now, too?
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
Well, I wouldn't say --
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
I just want to make sure that you both --
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
No...
Who's the pigeon?
I don't need it.
No frown lines.  New watch?
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
What?
What?
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
Well... I'm still...
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
I said yes.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
I know you do.
But why him?
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Thank you.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Your mother was.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
Yes. Again.
Oh Miles!
Fabric and fringe.
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
You do? You do love me?
That's true.
Murder?
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Marylin?
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Of Massey Myerson?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
I'm dying.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Ha Ha.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
That's attorney client privilege.  Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose --
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Miles.
-- the coin?
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
How is she?
Yes, I knowbut
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
South America!
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
What've you got against King Westley?
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business menparticularly if you're a shining example.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Fine man to fall in love with.
Is that his name?
I'm sorry you read it.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Amateurs!
What happened to your money?
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkand if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Thanks.
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind. 
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Not at all. 
I can't go out like this.
Like what?
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Um. You're doing all right.
Santa Claus?
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
I don't trust that chatterbox.
Why, haven't you?
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
To New York?
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
knowbut
wasbut
Really?
Carrots.
You! Don't make me laugh.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
I love you.
You're forgetting you're married.
Same to you.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
Whome?  Want to see me?
Do you know?
Whatever you say, darling.
Left twenty minutes ago.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Why, he'll be back.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Get out!
Up yonder. See the lights?
Huh?
Wait a minute, GordonI
Huh?
Who's she gonna marry?
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
I ain't got a hat.
Collect.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
There's a seat over there for you.
That's right.
What's on your mind?
Five G'sor I crab the works.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Yeah ?How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Yeah. Just babies.
Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
You, Numa?
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Calm down, Dave, what?
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
...give me protection?
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
I want the truth.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
It's going to get worse, honey.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
Huh?
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
Take a look across the street.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
Allen Dulles?
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
More than ten years.
And he never hit you before?
Was he there often?
Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
Uh huh.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Not a problem.
Oh, that's not a problem.
Who?
Uh-huh.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
What's she want?
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
Thanks.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I thought you might want a drink?
Is it dark?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
Was she helpful?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
Cash poor?
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
What?... What'd you do?
Why?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
How'd you feel about it?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
I'm old enough to be her father.
I go back to work tomorrow.
They seem to like the idea.
I called you last night.
Has he hinted around?
Why?
It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
Which one?
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
In a dress.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
He's liable to shoot you.
Less ten percent.
I know.
I'm just tired in general.
We can look into that.
You never asked me if I did or not.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Uh-huh.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
That would be one point of view.
Keep it between us girls?
It looks good on you.
I was expecting you. Come in.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
Talk to you tomorrow.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
They already know it's you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
Who?
Plus the same deal as before.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
Bank robbery.
No.
C'mon, don't lie.
Must of made quite an impression.
Sure.
...and just take it from him.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Okay, Lou-is.
What's your cost?
That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.
That's good money.
I'm in my underwear.
Yeah.
I follow.
She believed you?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
What does that mean?
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
So what, you left her there.
Twice. In the parking lot.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
In the chest and stomach.
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
We went to the parking lot.
How am I supposed to know that?
Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!
I think I do. Is that good enough?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
He's a big one. You two tight?
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Ten thousand sounds high.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
I need your name and address.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
What does she do for you?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Git your ass in here.
Uh-huh.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
That I gotta see.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
I know where it is.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
You better be, motherfucker.
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
It's all been a dream.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
Oh God!
LET GO!
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
What do you mean?
I'm hanging up.
Hey, wait!
Don't bother to call again, okay?
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
I am.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
Used you?
Shit!
Her knee acting up?
Sarah.
She talk about the boys?
I'm walking, aren't I?
I haven't seen her in months.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
What happened to you?
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
What?
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
Come on. What were they, Jake?
Oh, come on. It's early.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Are we in Brooklyn?
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I promise.
I love you when you're angry.
Where have they gone?
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
I don't know you.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Then don't bug me.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors.
Long time ago.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
I'm awake?
Nothin' much.
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
Is he all right?
You got lucky.
Pause play.
Oh, come on!
Could you show a little compassion?!
And you said high school was boring.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
They're back here.
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Thorgan, suit up.
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
Hey, easy now.
You got that right.
You just keep an eye out.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Guys!!! The shuttle?
No you don't!
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Let's just get out of here.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
Oh my God! Adrienne?
You killed him?
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Ow!
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
I missed you too.
Then open the doors!
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
Just a favor for your old man.
Sure, Dad.
What?
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
You got it.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
Have you ever had one do this?
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
No shark did that to a boat!
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
That wasn't funny.
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
I'm supposed to be running.
But you copy my work every week.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
I still have your virginity!
No...
Huh?
Yeah. That was me.
I try really hard, actually...
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
I rock a Harmony.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
You're kidding!
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
What?
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
I went to the doctor today.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
I'm pregnant.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
You sound shocked or something.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
They're yellow.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
What?
She answered our prayers.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
...I said, I like your hair.
...Yeah, sure.
He whips you?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Almost.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
As many times as it takes.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Walter Livesy.
Vernon, Florida.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Now why is that?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
Damn right I do.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
A book on the warehouse murders?
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
No, never. Excuse me.
Siesta.
Shut your mouth.
Everybody just shut up!
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
What is it?
...Janitor's job.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Did what take?
How long did you fuck her?
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
Right.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Den less go Joe.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Yeah.
Right.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
That.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
Shut up.
You are?
Nothen' B.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
She won't? Why not?
Yeah. I can understand that.
Why is that?
I wouldn't believe it?
What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.
No.
Are you in trouble with the law?
Yeah?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
Whah is dissdee?
Whah you say? Dissdee?
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
Yes.
What are you saying?
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
No.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
What was your relationship with her?
Maybe he's going to drug her?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
What?
You know her?
Just like who?
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
What makes you think I was there?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
You don't understand.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Six, eight hours tops.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
It's important.
And this Jeremy--
Meaning?
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
That's a big area to cover.
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
Ten days ago.
Through a rental agency.
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
A building?
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Just thought you might want to talk.
I can check and call you back.
We'll call you back.
Are you one of the players?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
Why?
Because I think he's wrong.
I'm sorry.
It was.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Why not?
Thank you, but I can wait.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
You will know, in good time.
Where the spiral begins.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
No! You cannot know that!
I forbid you!
I road them often in my youth.
Let me comfort you.
What business?
How did you know I had sons?
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
A flicker of talent.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I have a cinnamon bar.
You do?
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
Would you desert your friends?
And do you think I live on air?
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
Then look!
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
That I am, my lady.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
Yes.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
That is true.
I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
...Not at all.
Perfect.
Yes, yes...
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
...Because I feel it.
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
Mathilda, stop, please!
...OK.  I love you anyway.
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Three times, then two times.
Huh? That's smart!
...And how much is it?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
Can it kill me?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
We can do it together.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Anything?
I've changed my mind.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
That's a reasonable assumption.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
Is that right?
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
Why know?
I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
Good morning.
What are my choices?
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
You do?
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
No?
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
Yeah... I'd like that.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
How much, do you think?
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
It's me, Yuri.
I have a 4.0.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Tell him, Paulette.
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
No, she was crying her eyes out.
-- uh --
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Licensed attorney or family member?
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
Really?
You guys are so sweet!
You think?
No way --
Why?
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
And you know this for a fact?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
I just don't understand what went wrong --
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
Really --
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
Of course, I do!
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
East coast people are different.
You go where?
Do anything exciting?
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Pull up next to him!
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Then we smash 'em?
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
Grotesque... monstrous...
I am afraid of nothing.
Why have you brought me here?
To be my bride, of course.
Do it now!
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
It's terrible.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
Will you lead me to her?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow...
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
There's the way, mates.
Willful creature, that one...
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Will you chance a miss?
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Hurry up!
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
I was with the Princess.
That's it then... the ring!
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
No, no, no... this is different!
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
If you like.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
You've freed me, Jack...
That's why he goes masked during the day...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
And I... love you...
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
Lili... I love you!
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Pinching me!
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
Not very precise directions.
What became of the princess?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
And am I not fair?
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
Be fair, Oona.
We wait.
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
That very nice.
You follow.
What are you doing?
I thought I might stop by.
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Why?
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
Turn over.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
Why are you so uptight?
I've been dreading you.
To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
Well, I feel better about this now.
I didn't recognize you!
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
Because I live there.
I'm not going!
No.
A friend of yours is here.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
Try it.  It feels good.
What would you like to be?
That's not true.
He's got nothing to do with me.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
To hide a black eye.
Why wouldn't she leave?
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
I haven't been touched in years.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
Three.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
He doesn't answer.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
I was parked in day parking.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
What?
Which?
The first and the last.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Do you remember?
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
I think so.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
So could I.
Not a perfect day.
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
It's not ours.  It's George's.
No.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Why?
Yes, it is.
That's my girl.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
But you can't.
No, but...
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
But I'm having a good time...
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
Guess we better get going, huh?
What are you talking about?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
On your behalf. What happened to we?
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
I'm stuck!
I know people.
Let me see that.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Back to New York for starters.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
It's too late for plans.
Why the hell not?
You didn't get ketchup?
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
I'm all right.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
Move it out.
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Anybody else need anything read?
Greenville, that the nearest town?
That's a long story...
Blacks welcome there?
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
He's sick?
It's just such a slap in the face.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
I'm calling you out, brother...
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
Try an angel.
Yeah, you do...
It would be so okay.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
What can I do about it?
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Yes, great movie...
All right...
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Why would you be floating?
..."The Devil?"...
That was Cassius!
Off limits.
Yeah. The deep South.
Your turn.
We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
We're ready.
What other food?
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
I'm fine...  See you...
Why did you do that???!!!
Yes... probably he was renewed?
No.
You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
All right.
About running, dying what?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
It's different now. Help me.
What do you need?
If you trusted me, you'd know.
I have.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
But what is this -- why?
Muscle? I don't know that one.
They won't listen.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
We'll be all right...  We will...
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
To what?
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
What's that?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
All right.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
Can you make it back?
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
What?
Sure, I'm okay.
Right... This just glided along.
Or something.
Yeah... Laurent.
What's that, Ed?
So what do we do?
We should stop seeing each other.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
What deal?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What's he do?
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Okay...
Yes.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Do ya good.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Did you tell the police this?
When he went to work, right.
Pete, what happened to you?
No.
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
Tone deaf.
No, no. I want to go in.
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
Alice who?
When you didn't come to the club.
From the club. You didn't answer.
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
Yes, I just found it on the step.
All right.
I thought there might be somebody inside.
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Which would you choose?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
You want some company?
Sure. Sure I do.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Yes, sir.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Okay, brother.
Don't call me brother.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Look here
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Now you're irritating and absurd!
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Please don't call me Lovey.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
They were in a quandary, and
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Well - I'm
That's intelligent.
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Well, is it?
You're startled?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
Oh, I'm so glad.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Pardon me
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Yes.
Oh, the girl at the piano?
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Yes, Bob.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
What do you mean if we should get out?
That's what you said.
That's what's on the other side of the hill.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
You can't leave, George.
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
Come on! We're wasting time!
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Home?  You gotta be kidding me.    Black?
DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
We wear black.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
Ha ha.  No, really.
A what?
I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
What if he's telling the truth?
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Nothing.
Yeah, Kay?
What if I don't?
The what?
Fine.  Good.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
Actually, I don't know...
Don't tell me.  Insects.
He'll turn around.
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
What is it?
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Oh, Jesus...
That's comforting.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
-- go blind.  I know.
Try again.
Don't apologize, John.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
You're kidding, that's today?
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Did Marks close the front door?!
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
You mind if I tag along?
Yes.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
She said...
So now I need you to hack into her.
Tell me how.
Uh, I'll try...
I was looking for you...
Good-bye, Dad...
He's alive?
The precogs were wrong.
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Kill me!
I'm... not... a... killer.
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
Why?
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
I don't know who that is.
Lamar --
He just wanted a few minutes before --
My God...
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
We can stop him.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
What kind of cop were you before this?
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
Who?
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
Cream and sugar.
You mean after he lost your son.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
What does he want with a precog?
What are you talking about?
Is it the good room?
As far as...?
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
He's okay.
He's not doing it.
What time is it there?
Where were you?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Who's watching the baby?
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
With what?
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
Yeah.
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Quick drop. In and out.
Ricky's taken care of.
That's it.
Pshhh...
No.
Yeah. Sorry.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
Good morning.
Traveling light. I like that.
Ricky's taken care of.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
What about it?
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
He implied it.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
Nah, don't bother --
Great. On my fucking room.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Well, I don't want to walk.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Motherfucker...
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
Fuck this.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Did you hear what he just said?
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
No.
Eighty.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
It's gonna be fine.
No more, man.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
No. I'll wait here.
I'll be a minute.
Tom. How's it going?
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
Fuck...
And you grew up in Manhattan?
A little.
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Where do you live?
Coke?
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
Four fernet.
We're going to New York?
That money is your per diem.
Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
So, we're talking money laundering...
And where might that be?
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
What?
Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
What you talking?
You owe me six big ones.
You never had it.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
There's two guns on you.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
Man, what do you want?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
What the hell for, man?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
I don't know what to say to Allah.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister.
She ate.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
Just an idle question.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
What have you set your mind to?
I love you.
I'm not made of glass.
I just want to sit here and be still.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
What did I tell you about assuming?
Let's cancel.
Entirely.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
Yes, sir, I did.
I ain't stupid.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
You're my father.
And don't come back.
Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
Shorty, this is Laura.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
No.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[I'm on to Juarez.]
I have connections.
[Si.]
[What is his name?]
[Who's the boss?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[I want you.]
[Correct!]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
I drink.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Time will tell.
No.
But why not?
You need to practice.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
You don't drink like you used to.
You think too much?
It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
Because...  I was already dead.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Do you know what she told me last night?
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
For a year?
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
What was she to Creasy then?
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
I could see she likes you.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
It's early.
Where you going?
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
We just talked.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
I feel fine.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Well, I always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news.
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Yes, I know.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Nothing.
Okay.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
Are you kidding?
No, I'm not kidding.
I'm just here with another girl.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
Oh, that's a sad story.
About eight o'clock.
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
You want a beer, Ang'?
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
On accounta...
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
What the hell's going on here?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
We been had.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
An application to Androscoggin College.
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
Ravenous. What about you?
I can't... couldn't.
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Oh, Jesus.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
Maria...
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Yes, Reverend?
What do you want with those two medical officers?
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
You mean who hit who?
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Sir?
I can try, sir.
They can't do that to me!
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
Now?
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
You got me.
Yes!
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Uh-huh . . .
Yes, sir.
Money.
No, no, nothat's your seat.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
That's
I used to pitch.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
Beany!
Look!
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
John Doe Club?
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
No.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Flowers.
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Yeah, okay.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
How can I help you with the particles?
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
Roper...
Is that all?
For now that's all.
I'll give you something.
I know.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
You living together?
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
Do you really?
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
What's the first commandment?
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
And doing a very good job of it.
And what about the ones you don't save?
Which apartment?
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
What do you want from me?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
Ronnie...
As a matter of fact, I do.
Yeah that's it.
When?
Just now.
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
...Let me just show you.
And you think he'll...
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
SHIT!
What?
Are you going to make this hard for me?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Guests?
Not my problem.
So wrong --
Not real?
I'm South Dakota.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- Yes.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
To hide the evidence.
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Then how do you know about --
Corporation can.
Her?
Sorry?!
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Just like that --
Program name?
Describe program function.
Male.
Speed?
What?!
There should be a way to open it.
About twenty seconds in your time.
I think so.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
Look closer.
SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!
You want me to place a few calls?
What do you mean "basically"?
How'd you know?
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Why should I be?
So what happened?
And now you have everything.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
Shane was a friend of yours?
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
That's it.
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
It's too late.
My friends have a country house we can use for a while.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
It always is.
I'm doin' business here!
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
No. We ain't even...
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
Might as well put the time to use.
It'll just be a few minutes.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
What's your problem?
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
I know about you.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
But that's an hour's drive.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
That's why I'm here.
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
You wouldn't live out the week.
Best we got.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
What?
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Well - you'd need a body.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Back? You're sending me back?
Death! Thank you!
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
How much?
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
You're acting kind of...odd.
<i></i> In what way?
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Are you okay??
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
<u>What</u> union?
The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!
<i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
I'm good.
Aaron?
Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.
And where is she?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
But it *isn't*?
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
What's this, Diz?
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
And to Don Quixote!
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
How about getting married?
No--not offhand--
Huh?
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Horace Mill--!
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
Himself!
What stuff?
Than what?
Jeff for Senator.
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
For a question!
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Thank you, sir.
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
No. What had you better--?
Why?
Try sitting down.
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
He did?
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
Have you always had to--work?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Well, if it's all the same to you--
Abigail.
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Great.
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Already? All these letters?
Well, I guess it's a chance.
What you *have* to do is fight!
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!
Ring the call to quorum.
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
Swell!
What! Who?
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Let's get away from here. 
Susan!
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
No?
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Senator Paine.
Some people like it.
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
He sure is pixilated.
He sure is.
No, no children.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Thank you very much.
Why not?
Are these the articles?
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, I don't mind.
Huh?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Yeah, I know.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Let's just walk, okay?
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Nothing.
We're not going out tonight.
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"
Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
I tell you that dame's nuts.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
Who? Miss Dawson?
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
Me, sir?
Me sir?
Better wire him right away, John.
Proceed.
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
But your honor
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Buffer?
What for?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Huh?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Nah.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Arthur wants to quit!
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Shut up!
Why, it's an artistic institution
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
No, I mean - about my client.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
I don't know.
South Dakota north.
Thank you so much. Good night.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
You must have been concerned.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Not any more.
So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
My approach?
What's that?
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Henry!
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
Do you want to come in?
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
Okay.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
Sure I can, Lionel.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Is she a friend of yours?
Do you think that's a good idea?
Just who is here, can you tell me?
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
It doesn't matter. Go on.
You like it?
And this is legitimate therapy?
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
That's what I like.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.
Okay...
But...
What do you mean, "in no time"?
In maybe three or four issues.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
What do you want me to see?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
Really?
He agreed?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
It's not?
What about everything? How did this happen?
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
You're completely reliable.
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
What does he want the book for?
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
Intestines.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
You will not believe it.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
Proceed!
No, I mean --
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
How?
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
Why would I do that?
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
That's what I am to you? A contract?
Yes?
I'm your sister.
That just makes you more gullible.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Um, well, you see...
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
And some sandwiches --
Me, too.
Against.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Sure -- I guess.
Roy.
Yeah.
Roy.
Bye. 
And a skunk stinks!
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
SO WHAT?
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
Are you coming or not?
Not a chance!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Or flowers.
No.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Definitely.
Sorry.
Shut up.
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
But how do we get in?
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
Proceed.
What do you mean?
No, thank you.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
Properly arranged, yes.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Ajaccio.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
How did it spread so quickly?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.
I'll have the fire built up.
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
You are my old friend.
Open the door.  It's me.
Yes!!
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
Yes, I wrote it.
How do you know?
I know.
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Can you give me a drink, please?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Good.
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Don't move me.
I'm his cousin.
Black magic.
What about the dog?
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Nothing.
The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
I don't know.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Well bring yo' ass on...
It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this...
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
I don't know, Debo.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
I don't know.
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
Elroy.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
I've been a bad boy.
Huh?
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
What about the gun?
No, please...
No, that's,..that's fine
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
How did you see us kiss?
It's a twenty.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
Cover your mouth.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
Kill the Governor.
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
Fuckin' A.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
I've done much better ones than this.
Why?
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
I kill her anyway.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
How's your sister Pearl?
Don't!
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
You have all sinned!
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
How do you mean?
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
You better not sing that song.
Yes, I reckon that's it.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
She talks to herself.
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
I'll make coffee.
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Yes?
What secret shall I tell?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
All right.
Can I have this?
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
Harry, what --
I -- no, I --
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
What's wrong, John?
What are you after them for?
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
You believe in anything?
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
Hi.
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
My dream.
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Just want to talk to him a second.
Sure, but...
School.
Get into bed.
Right.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you...
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
Jungle man fix Jane.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
What do you wear in the morning?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Yes.
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
Just for the honeymoon.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
Or it might be the firing squad!
Right now it's on the balcony.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
How many families live here with you?
We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
But, Comrades...
Have you?
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
We did our best, Comrade.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
Private.
Me?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
What?
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
And where are we?
Your type will soon be extinct.
I will do my best.
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
That is correct.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Then do it through my lawyer!
Just smile.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
Did you make any change in this room?
When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
Shhh! Shhh!
No speech?
No speech.
Yes... a kiss... salute!
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Yes, sweetheart. 
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
You haven't seen her yet?
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
May I ask why?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
So ... let's go ...
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
What?
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Jesus!  Through a window?
Mitchell?
Who?  Not another goddamn Cuban?
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice.
I had no knowledge of the cover-up until John Dean told me about it on March twenty-first.  And I did not intend that payment to Hunt or anyone else be made ...
Can we get around this, Al?
And if I stay?
That was civil war.
That's right ...
I don't know anything about that.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
"National Priority."
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
When I met with him, he said ...
Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
Why me?
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
Kissinger?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world.
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
Yes.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
Jesus Christ!
It broke my heart when Harold died.
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
The hell with 'em.
Sir?
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You don't have to go.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
Do you really want this, Dick?
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Can I just ask for one thing?
I've missed you.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
And what am I doing?
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
You don't know what he thinks.
Nothin'?
He won't neither. He never has.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
Gun out and up.
Well I don't either!
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
No sir.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
I never do.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
No.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Llewelyn --
Mama's gonna raise hell.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
You are comin back, ain't ya?
I can hear it in your voice.
You go to hell.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
Do you know where I'm going?
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
Sixty-nine cent.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
For what?
The option.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
How would you describe him?
I know how he found me.
Took me about three hours.
What did you do?
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
Bad idea...
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Well, do something, then, damnit!
No, I was just... How you doing?
Do you know why I'm here?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
What are you talking about?
You're late, Eric.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
Man, that is love.
The Five?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
He has a wife?!
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
How many men have I talked to?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
You should have a little faith in people.
Where are you going?
I have to leave now.
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
If we're for real?
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Of what?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
...and put them in your mouth.
That is so right.
Hell of a way to die.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
I'm not telling.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
You need to remember who you're talking to...
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
We know that...
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
I SAID FORGET IT!
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Oh fuck...
Because it ain't natural, young man.
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
Huh?!
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
Oh my God!
That ain't it!
Latch right on to that tit.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
Isn't it, uh...
Aw, that's all right.
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
You got it, Sweet Pea.  Nice boonies, Seeger.
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
No, sir!
Not exactly, sir.
I thought I recognized the work.  Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Yes, sir!
What did you call me, boy?
No.
No, sir!
No, sir!
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
No, sir.
Vietnam?
Or we could do that yeah.
Then, I'll see you around.
How late?
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
Come on. Let's go dance.
I got my foot on the floor.
Great.
Everything was different.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
There's always a choice.
I don't want you to move.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Twenty-two years ago.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
Sure.
Naw.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
No problem, but who's Susan?
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Do you know that for sure?
Please...
I can't...
That's their problem.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
Where did you get this clown?
Pure idiot.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Shit!
Yeah, whatever.
Everything okay?
No, you can't come in.
Oh, that phone call...
Open it.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,
What?
Open the door.
And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I am.  I'm here.
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
Not an option.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Oh shit Alma... you're...
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
Yeah... whatever you say.
I don't know. Look around man.
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Can you make a deal with them?
As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.
Yes sir, I did.
Alone...
So what's the deal?
I don't know about that.
I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
What are you saying?
Shut the fuck up!!
Why didn't you tell me?
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Yeah.
Uh... uh... I...
You call that a compliment?
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
The hell I do.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
Very well, then.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
How can we end this madness?
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
Is that so?
Yes, sir.  My father taught me.
Yes, sir.
God help us all when you're forty.
No...
She got me at a more impressionable age.
What?
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
Go on.
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
Thank you.
Where is he now?
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Yes... you will wait.
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Well, I thought it was safe--
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Yes.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
Yeah, sure.
Well, maybe I----
What?
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you...
This babe has said enough.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
Nope. He's your cat now.
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
Jesus, the road!
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Elizabeth goes free!
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
That so?
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
It's a pirate medallion.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
I can't breathe.
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
To the Black Pearl.
What's your plan?
I know.  That was for the smell.
Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
Is that so?
'Bootstrap?'
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
No, it's not.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
But --
No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
Maybe you should, but you can't.
Ain't it.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Yeah, I do!
I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
Who isn't?
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Right.  You predicted it.
Yeah, we'll see.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
I don't know.
I'm a plastic man!  A plastic man!
No, why?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Probably the caffeine.
Do you have something to bring me down?
It's still inside me?
No cheese.
I have to!
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
Don't worry, four eyes.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
You're all right.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
No - give you another guess.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Gallagher!
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
Oh, man!
I'm afraid.
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
Gloria Golden?
Right - for the first time this year.
Why not?
And live on your salary, I suppose?
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
Drunk, sir?
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
What could I be?
You quit trying to stop anybody
Well, at best you might deny it.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Surely, come right in.
She did?
It's all right. Bring him in.
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Heavens! The man's insane!
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
It can't be possible.
I won't.
Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
Bud?
Here's my favorite.
She's crying.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Oh, gosh no.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
But where would we go?
It's six-thirty ...
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Okay, that's IT!!!
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
It was accessible to everyone.
Very well ...
Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
Okay--that's enough!
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
What are you doing?
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
They don't notice that kind of thing.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Well if I don't who will?
What?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
No. I baked them for you.
Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
Hunh?
Real rain?
Sure ...
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
What the hell's going on!
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
Excuse me?
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why?
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
Why?
Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.
Just gimme the damn remote!
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
I'm so glad you're here.
Yeah ...
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
I'll never be able to do that.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
TV repair?
A miracle.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
D&D Mattress Man.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
That's your fault not mine.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Do you like porno movies?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I didn't lie.
No.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.
Ok.
Sure.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Alright?
It's Barry.
You like her?
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
You see?
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Nothing.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Yes? I'm trying.
...yeah...
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
If you come to Hawaii --
You don't think you'll go --
Really?
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Lena?
It's Barry.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
Yeah.
Yes I'm sorry.
Did you have my home phone number?
On my knife.
I didn't do that.
I didn't do it.
The police are on their way.
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
Hi Walter.
You ok?
Why you wearin' a suit?
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
....yes.....
WHICH?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
Please don't do this.
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
You can't be late.
I know.
I know.
Ok.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
What's the problem?
What did you say?
Are you sure?
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Should I call you later?
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
Why not?
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.
You always do.
That's enough.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
Valcour. His chair.
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
AND DID YOU?
Go to hell!
Well...?
Shut down?
You're a sentimental man.
And --?
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
I'll be waiting.
Don't start --
I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
Is it awfully violent?
Is it terribly erotic?
What's that then?
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
Sure you can, just--
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
Uh-huh
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
Yes?
Why did we not know about this sooner?
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
George...
Oh God.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human sacrifice.
Very generous
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
Get out.
Again
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
I'm Ok.
All right, you guys, shake hands.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
And where you goin'?
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Go ahead.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Go 'head.
How do you know? You know her that good?
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
You wasn't with her?
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
What did Tommy say?
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Nine o'clock.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
It feels real good.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
That's all right. He don't mind.
Jake...
Now take your panties off.
Positive.
You're hurting my arm.
Jake...
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
What're you talking about?
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong. 
What?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
Then what?
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
Are you drunk?
All right, just don't make any noise.
C'mon, Tommy --
All right, I'll try. See you later.
No, you're his wife.
Namely?
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
You think I made all this up?
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
I think they missed their chance with her.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Mrs. Thorwald.
Your logic is backward.
All the things I hate.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
Wrong day?
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
How?
She expects me to marry her.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
She pay you much?
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
Not a word.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Tired?
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Homework. It's more interesting.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
125 West Ninth Street.
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
That's what the witnesses told him.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
L. B. Jefferies.
Chelsea 2-5598.
A new disease.
I'm glad they let you out.
Jim Stark.
Okay.
Down in back.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Hang loose.  We got all night.
Yeah!  Shh!
I better clean this up before she sees it.
I'm not hungry.
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
Really, Frank?  When was that?
I was talking to Jim.
Are you going down there?
Open it.
Stay here.  That was my son!
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
Plato.
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
No.  In the morning.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
Who has?
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
We'll take it!
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Why?
Goodbye, dear.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
No.
Try the desk.
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
You serious?
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
You weren't looking for company, were you?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Are you and Mom home tonight?
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Must have a way with stationery.
We're talking, aren't we?
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Yeah.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
I love you!
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
I'm almost done.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
You said it a million times!
The hell I can't.
So you could get down her chimney.
And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.
Her brother.
I don't know.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Get out.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
Leave the tree.
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
I don't steal any --
He's not Nick Mason...
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
Hi, Nick.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
It's a roach, guy --
Ain't there yet.
And some pecan pie.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Standing right here, man!
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
I... sorry, Mister...
I'M NOT NICK!
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Was he all pissed off?
Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
I don't know, but somebody did.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Me and Mr. White?
The Brewers.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
What for?
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
Sorry, it's my book now.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
He don't believe in it.
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Lie back down, and try to -
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
Fuck all that.
As opposed to good?
I'm cool.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
Uh-uh, just cops.
I got the diamonds.
I think he's just passed out.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
Maybe he did.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
They're stragglin'.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
Why do you think?
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
All right -- it's said!
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
I haven't got the job yet.
No they won't.
I don't want to run short.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
This is an awful nice gun.  Certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
Swimming.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
You want to split up? --
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
Kind of sore.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
Three men on matched roans?
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
I can't take her with me.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
I'm sorry. Let's go.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
Yes, people make me restless.
They went on like I told you.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
I sure would.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Wife?!
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Never happened!
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Can you feel that?
Listen to me I --
That's what your man is supposed to do.
Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
That means more screen time for us.
It's the sequel.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Right behind you.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
Theo, did you see the animal?
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Don't touch me!!
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
Right. What about condoms?
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
What?
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Oh, I couldn't do that.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
My help?
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Because she will lie?
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
Don't worry, I got your back.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
Mrs. Sutphin?
Is there a killer loose?
Why?
I don't feel like rewinding it!
Looks good, Mom!
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
We can be real quiet...
I love that you're my wife.
You bring me such peace...
Ooohhhh!
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
I certainly was not!
Marvin A. Pickles.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
...Browsing.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Yes.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
No. It's my father -- I wanted to talk to you -- you wrote about cures --
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Hello, Frances.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
But I like teaching school.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
I guess most people are.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
Good.
A job?
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
Well, that's illuminating.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
That you love Mary.
No!
And then?
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
I'm at sea, Jason.
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
I have to go -
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
She was my patient.
It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
I should like people to read what I've written.
I'd forgotten.
Yes. When I tell you.
You know where she is?
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
I didn't know.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Well...
Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
How do you mean?
I feel like they do.
Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.  I'm getting confused.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Not really.
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
I'm sorry this came up.
Maybe you want to go.
I know.
Then do it.
Sometimes. Afterward.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
And you feel the same way with John?
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
Who'd you have lunch with?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Why don't I believe you?
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
I want out of this marriage.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Is he still at your house?
Do you want to leave therapy?
He doesn't have a phone.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
What's wrong with that?
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
No, I didn't.
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
You touched him?
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
Thirty-two dollars.
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
He said that my hand felt good.
Prettier than Ann?
Okay.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
So make an exception.
No.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
No.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Could be risky.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
She's there? What's she doing there?
What do you mean?
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
No.  You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.
Will you lease month-to-month?
You have family here also?
She held up very well.
So is my wife, asshole!!
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
No.
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Brian Kirkland, please.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
No. I don't think so.
Nick, you're so strange...
Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
NIGHT NIGHT
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
I tell you what's cooking.  She made the blind see and it was a gift!  Who was it from?  Let's hear an 'F" for...
What?
I got it!  I got it!!!
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
SPONSOR!!!
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
Could you tell us a little about it?
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
Do you really think so?
F for...
Flavors!
YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
You guys having fun?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Shut up.
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
I want to go home now.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
Bathroom.
Yeah. Okay.
Right now.
With this chick.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
You're an asshole.
Could be anything.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
Let's leave it alone.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Thanks.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Yeah.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Me?
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
That's what I'm having.
Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Yeah. Definitely.
Oh. You mean... today?
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Sure.
Yeah.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
I'm sure he believed every word.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Miles?
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
I told you I need a drink.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
It tastes old.
This one?
I see.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
Yes.
Got it!
From what?
Don't.
Where are we going to sleep?
No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
He definitely wasn't a midget.
They think it might happen all at once.
What book!
...And you had to kill him?
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
Sure.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Yeah... that must have been it.
It's one thing to know it...
That I do.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Ten A.M.
I haven't done anything.
Where's the pinto going?
South of here, past Chimayo.
I expect.
It's not going to be easy.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
Yeah?
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
Believe it.
Right!
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
I don't like that word much, Carter.
You're kidding.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I thought we talked about that.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Who's the owner?
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
Of course.
Why not?
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
No.
Thank you.
Excuse me?  Start?
I want you back too, Viktor.
Because obviously she existed, right?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
Of course.
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
You do?
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
Hello, sweetheart.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
-- I know, I don't know anything.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
An insanity defence.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
Don't you?
This should take care of Mother.
My God, you've got one?
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
Is that why she left you?
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
But that's Simone's part.
What if it catches on fire?
You know what I'm talking about.
That's good.
How do you draw now?
You hate him?
That I'm a freak.
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
You believe me, right?
Yes, I am.
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
You believe now?
And you know what else?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Maybe.
Standing next to my window.
What?
Like what?
S-ssstop that!
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
See?
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Slut.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
I didn't do anything --
No shit.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Bus broke down.
I could. You sucked.
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
"-- an AXE!"
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
-- It's not me!
I --
Who? Us?!
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Second verse!
Bill, we need to talk!
Just checking out the lights.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
No. What?
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
Starla, it ain't --
Shelby!
Sorry.
I got to leave my post.
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Sure you do.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Gold--digger, huh?
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Why? You have a bowling date?
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Having fun.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
Weight Station.
Well, thanks for the lift.
That man is your father?!?
But you'll do it?
I'll do it.
Another time.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Waynette!
Why are we doing this?
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
I hate to say it...
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
We're gone.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
We'll be waiting. Over.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Go breaker.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Yes, sir.
That's correct.
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Yeah.
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Ww... uh...
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
Then what --
I said I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
Without peer?
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."
-- will be handled back in --
-- no, we need to handle it now.
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
...Yeah, fifty-three.
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
Fuck you.
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
You're not Gibarian...
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Listen --
Yes.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
You fucking bastard...
How?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
How long can you go without sleep?
Just a little strategy session.  But in person this time.
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
No.
Her oxygen would have run out.
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
I'll just be a minute.
I want you inside me right now.
You didn't look very happy.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
He has a point.
You don't love me.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
Rheya --
You should have told me.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
I wish you wouldn't.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Fuck me.  I knew it.
Looks a little constipated to me.
Right.  That's true.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
You were reading my Renoir.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Yeah.  It was.
Tell it like it is.
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Do you dance?
"To"... Forget about you.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
My ass is falling.  It is.
Get in bed.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
Where'd you get the tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
I just sat and listened.
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
I heard.
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
You in this with me?
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
No, sir...
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
I don't really see what that has to do with...
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
How about dinner tonight?
We're gonna pass the street.
Let me see.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
Flash, drop it--
Hm.  What a lump.
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
Yeah--
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
Even if they're not clever.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
You sure about all this?
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Use a fork.
See?  You big dullard.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
What?
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
I'm not so happy myself.
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Jawohl.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
In this barracks?
Who is it?
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
You are talking crazy!
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
No?
It's not good for you, Animal.
Anything else?
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
What radio?
Are we boring you?
Says me.
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Who did?
Check.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
I'll kill you for that!
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
Just don't drool on it.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Full disruptors.
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
Why would you want to leave?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
Yes, yes, it is.
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
I hadn't planned on it.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
What is it?
I went wrong.
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Fire, Mr. Scott!
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Sir, may I --
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
I'm not a drama critic.
All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
... taking Genesis away from us...
What's the matter -- ?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
I'm Doctor Marcus!
What?
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
We'll be going to warp speed --
Try the emergency channels...
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Give the word, Admiral.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
The power of creation --
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Be careful, Jim...
Uhura, patch me in --
Yes --
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
... No, sir. It has not.
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Scotty!
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's very human.
Aye, sir.
By the book...
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
-- That's the general idea.
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
Shields, aye.
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
I was not.
How soon?
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
Or believe, I'll bet.
You're upset about losing the whales.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
But Kirk...
... Damn!
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The late 20th Century.
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
... Aye sir...?
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
Mercy Hospital.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Humpbacked - people.?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
I'll have to re-energize.
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
You will be in good hands here.
Of course.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Just use the keyboard...
Right on. You fly?
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Tell her I feel fine...
Why?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
What's the rush?
Perhaps, that is true.
No one's ever asked me that before.
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
From the mission...
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours.  There is still a way home, Gal'na.
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Commander Riker...
Beam him out!
Transferring controls to manual.
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Or you could try lying down.
I never kissed you with a beard before.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
You think they're still up there?
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
I am the Borg.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
I'm on it...
Ready.
Jean-Luc Picard.
Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
I can try.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
I am not a thief...
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Wil... Data was down there.
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
You may need assistance, doctor...
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
We're not finished.
More than ever.
That cunning little Vulcan...
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
To be -
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
Then let me help!
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
How can I trust --
Those words WERE spoken by me.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Shields up, Captain --?
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
Kill him! He's the one!!
Possibly.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Sir?
I was asked by my father to open neg-
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Not as yet, sir.
Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
We've been ordered to -
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
You having hearing problems, mister?
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
This one can.
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
What exactly does that mean?
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat
Why?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
You're working late.
He turned out all right.
Is he very much like you were?
Yes.
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
Aye, sir... This way.
It'll only work for one of us.
Yes, sir.
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
Divert power and compensate.
Sir.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Why?
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
Deanna, on my mark.
On screen.
With or without the rest of the fleet?
New Praetor?
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
Who was it?
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
You know I need to verify this.
I know.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
But you want to.
Its too late.
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Seven minutes.
What?!
Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
He's got a gun!!
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Okay...
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Which way do you want to go?
Ah no.
Flashlight.
Money.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Yes. Very good.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
You'll see.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
No.
A drink.
You didn't even see it.
How will I do this one?...
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
No.
You want this ticket?
Can I have the gun?
It's bad.
I am your friend.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
I feel better if I move.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
I know how to gamble now.
Where?
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
What? No, of course not.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Get Fox.
Give it a rest, Lyman.
We're ready.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
Bullshit!
Wait'll you see it.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
It was a man though... right?
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Just not the eyes.
Watch and see.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
That's a good one, coming from you.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Talk to me about costs, here.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
No.  Bad idea.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
Your sex life?
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
Get it.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
Never really thought about it.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
The gas tank's going to go any second!
Fire's out, isn't it?
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
It was a tough call.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Uh unh.
Aw, Mom!
Take the tape to the cops.
Besides that.
Anybody talk to the press?
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
What does the Manager say?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
You must travel a lot, huh?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
You're a... you're sick.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
Maybe cause he's smart.
From the grave?
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
I'm hesitant to...
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I didn't use Low's name.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
"Gone live?"
Sex.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
Does Koessler ask about me?
You mean --
Then there's the other issue.
What's going on?
You were right. He found me.
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
What's going on?
I'll be back.
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
Suspect Zero?
"Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
If I owe, I will go.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
What did you do to end up here?
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
It's over for you.
You're right. I know.
...maybe...
Thank you, Nikki.
Like the quiche?
Yeah.
Like what?
To do what?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
Mike...
What an asshole.
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
Did you get it?
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Well, who represents you back east?
It's a rebound.
Six years.
I'll be around.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
Lorraine?
No, no. Hold on.
...Six months.
How are you doing?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
I mean, I need the money.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
Why?
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What'd you get?
That doesn't sound too good for business.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
I just tested for one...
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
Go for it, man.
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
Make someone bleed.
Wow, I guess you were home... 
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
What?
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
That's not cool.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
Let's go.
Did she, or did she not smile.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
No! Not the camera guy!
So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."?
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
Sorry about interrupting...
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
You looked right at her, baby.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
What a surprise.
Oh. He's got it under control...
Now?
True.
...you're money...
Now go over there and get those digits.
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...it's definitely on.
Our little baby's growing up...
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
Barzini.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Yeah.
Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
The gun will be there.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust.  That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety...
You want him to stay in this country.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
I know.
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
Thanks Tom.
Mike, why am I out?
How will they come at you?
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
A million times.
You think I scam?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Marge, you like everybody.
I don't like you.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Say again?
No, still here.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
No!
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
What club?
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
Sure.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
What about Christmas?
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Far cry from New York.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Okay.
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
It's superb.
I'm fine.
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
What?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
Ten thirty?
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
Do you want me to stick around?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
I really don't want to see anybody.
What about Thomas Ripley?
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Huh?
Where do you live?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
It keeps ya busy.
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I bought a couple of tickets.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
What's wrong?
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Can I call you?
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Have you been noticing anything strange?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Show me how he did that again.
What is it? I'm busy.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
You said that?
One-Ball McCall?
Stick up?
In the jungle. 122nd.
Don't you understand anything?
Don't you want to go?
Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a...
Pittsburgh.
He shoots dope too.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
You just gonna leave 'em?
What should I do? Call the cops?
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
How's your driving record?
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Some. Here and there.
Show it to me.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Tell me what you really do.
What, vou?
You knew?  All this time?
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
Thanks, I like it.  I think.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
I'm  fine.  Really.  
Oh.
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
Well, there's got to be a way...
No kidding.
Listen to me!  The young man in there...
Well, son, you're home!
What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which.  Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right?
But what?
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
A super market.  Huh.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
Well, yes, that she was.  She certainly made this place a home.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Dad, I...
I know, I know... keep still.
Anybody take it?
A few.
Zackly.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Pete...
No, sir.
Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
You should watch what you say.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
I can play the piano?
Yeah... me too.
My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
What exactly did you hear?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
All right.  All right.  We'll see.
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
A trifle.
And what had you done?
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
Morning.
That's where the Brenners live.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Where would I get a boat?
D'you want me to order one for you?
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Shall I call the doctor?
Well, you're the lawyer. 
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Lovebirds, I see.
Whose side are you on?
Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Yes.
Yes, Mother.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
That's a chance we have to take.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
These birds were...
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
I said I wonder if you could help me.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Some of them are.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
All right.  She smiles back.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
I think you're a louse.
Only violators and practical jokers.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
What did it say?
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Right next to the one you already had.
You are, aren't you?
Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
Will I be seeing you again?
How does Mother know what I like to do?
Without any clothes on?
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
Yes, but...
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
What did it say?
But you tore it up.
It is for me.
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
What'll it say?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
...everything I know.
We've got to get Cathy.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
Yes, certainly. 
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
How soon?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
Maybe! Is it impossible?
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
With smoke.
We need them.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Mr. Gray?
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.
Did he tell you about Georgina?
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
I am the best man for the job.
Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
The nerve centers -- the brain --
I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
We have never been friends.
Yes.
"Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest."
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
Aye.
Where are they?
I'm looking for my friends.
You sent them. I had no choice.
Tell her... we'll get him.
The strip joint?
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
Keep that thing away from me.
There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
Where the fuck did you come from?
The scar.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
I was talking about you.
Your father gave them to both of you.
No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
It's what Lauren would do.
It's not. I can't take it.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
But you, you've had them.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
It's not what you think.
No.
I don't believe you.
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
Maybe a little demonstration.
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
No -- I'm afraid not.
I thought that was only for bombs.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Why not, Bobby?
Goodnight.
About five months -- your months.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight, sir.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
Come on in.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
I'm not going to marry anybody.
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
Where is the meeting going to be?
"Klaatu barada nikto."
But how -- how long--?
I'm sorry.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
This one could save your life.
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
Yeah.
You gotta drive!
That's just the way we like it.
The baddest!
Hey, take it easy.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>.'
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
There's a cop behind us.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
You have a T.V.?
Who, Laddie?
It was a dream, Star.
He's not breathing, Mom.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Well, I...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I was here first.
Nanook...
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Just listen.
I know.
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Clark, you come on out here!!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
A serum test possibly.
After all this mess.
That far?
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Everything that's been missing.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
So what do you make of it?
MacReady, that you?
I had an accident.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
What happened?
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Last night.
Send him away.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
It was meant to.
The air... the power.
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
How?
I don't think that's going to happen.
And why not?
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
What's happening to the moon?!
Trust me...
No... let's walk through the city.
I was not.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Tonight's the night?
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
She's gotten into your equations.
You wouldn't believe me.
Good night, Alex.
Thank you...
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
What makes you say that?
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
More than 800,000 years.
You can see so many here.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
You know this?
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
May I get you some --
Might I ask why?
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
No, sir --
Sir --
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
My father has gone to a better place.
Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
I suppose so.
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
Then it's time to change that --
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
They're inside --
Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
It's not my job to believe you.
In where?
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
[Beat] You're his son?
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
Oh, yeah.
Why?
You two ok?
What for?
[Beat] What?
After I...
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
It's Sunday.
Ok, I guess.
Ok.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
I could try to...make it stop.
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
[Beat] I don't know.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
You have no idea what's going on.
And how do you know that?
I wasn't talking about anything.
Why?
Is it true?
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
Of course you don't know.
No, I'm ok.
[Beat] I do it.
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
In the leg.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
I have no problem with that.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
I always knew that.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Can't it go to any office?
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
Peaches.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Why now, Jimmy?
I'm choking on it.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Will I be?
I don't know.  I won't be.
It's probably not a good idea.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
You're right.
Before.
We should have just ignored him.
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
About how fast was I going?
Yeah.
What?
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  I mean Jimmy and everything.
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
What?!
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Way up ahead!
Fuck you.
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
What?
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
You're kidding? What did they say?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
Amen to that.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Uh-huh.
Yeah feels like it.
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
'That right?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Thanks.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
By the way, what's your name?
I already know it, Mary.
How'd you know that?
I beg your pardon?
Great.
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
How about -- ?
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
You're a movie buff?
Well, I'll see ya.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Any idea where I might start looking?
Well, I know you're busy...
Really?  Very, very?
So she hasn't changed?
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
Three different guys?
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
What do you mean 'why'?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
What?
You bet.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
You were following us?
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Mary, the man's a killer.
Hi, Mary.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
You look great.
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
Toy poodle!
You forgot your keys!
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.
Eh.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
What are you doing?
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Then they should speak up.
No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong.  We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
You know I don't mean they're weak.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
He was.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
What about you? Where are you going?
No you weren't.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
No way.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
Yeah, a good political solution.
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
Jesus...
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
No way, Cooch.
You're steppin' on sign.
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
Let's go.
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
What do you mean?
Sorry.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
Ray.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
Some Indian time?
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
Who did?
Move it, Magdelana.
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Yeow!
No.
I'm special.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
I'm different.
I'm starting to sense that now.
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
It's just as I thought.
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
And now I want you.
Off me or off you?
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
I know exactly what you mean.
...Something like that.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Remember one thing.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
YEAH, COUGAR?
Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
BREAKING LEFT!
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Swell! Passing ten thousand!
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
The list is long, but distinguished.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
Time to go.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Don't.
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
Figured out what?
Who is the best.
Bad?
Sir?
Yes sir!
The wings..
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
I lost.
You think I should quit?!
I'm nothing like him.
He was by the book, all the way.
What happened to them?
Take me to the hotel.
Thank you.
Would you like the same suite?
So why am I still alive?
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
I am Quaid.
Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
Don't be an idiot.
Why not?
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
At Rekall.
Swallow this.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
No shit...
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
And you believe him?
Lori, move.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
And falling in love?
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
Bullshit.
I'm honored.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
As real as any memory in your head.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Well, sure.
...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
I am not!
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Great.  Thank you.
You got <u>that</u> right!
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
I'm gonna help you.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
Yeah, Val.
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
"We"?
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
Yeah, well I had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the Fourth Amendment.
You fucking swear to shut up!
Of course.
-- Remember?
I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement.
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Let's get a cab.
I followed her from the courthouse.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
-- Me? Neither.
Neither.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
Right.
You don't drink "booze".
...Okay...
-- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
I want you.
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Can you tell me what their names were?
No you couldn't.
OK, Gordon.
Teresa Banks.
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
Tell me about the letter.
Someone else has it now.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
How do you figure?
That's what I heard.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
Not you, Donna, not you.
No, you should forget about last night.
What'll it be?
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
And what a muffin you have.
Let's go all the way.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
See what?
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
Trees?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
What were you doing in my room?
Good night, sweetheart.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Bobby didn't give you this?
You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
I'm fine.
How good's your intelligence?
The man's an ambulance chaser...
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
Yes. It would be.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
Just now...
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
Huh!
You may step down.
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
Well, many reasons, actually...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Yes!
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Thank you.
...and you're going to do that?
I understand.
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
How old is he?
Yes.
What did she say?
Yes.
What?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
That's what I'm going to try to do.
Well, then what are you doing here?
If I don't 'grow up...'
You, you don't under...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
You know what happened.
It's locked.
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
Uh...
...I'm going to need your help...
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
No.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Oh shit, what's today?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
I can't talk now.
The Doctors.
What?
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Should I?
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Hey, how about that!
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
But I think I know where she'll be....
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
It's gone now.
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
No.  I thought you had them.
Looks like the fishing was good.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
How would I know...!
He's very excited about it.
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
Like weird calls, by any chance?
No biggie, really.
Chase. Hi...
Heather, has there been another call?
Diabetes?
They were safe and could sleep.
The mean old man with the claws.
A story?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
When do you think it'll be done?
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
Listen, dammit.
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
That was Nancy, not me!
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
My child?  No...but...
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Black's fine.
Your father?
I am about this.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
I didn't know sir.
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Yes sir.
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
No, I can't.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
What's the difference?
We all have problems.
No, I didn't.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Forget it.
It works?
Jesus, you never told them?
I couldn't.
Speak up boy!
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
Sir...?
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
And being sixteen.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
It hurts too much to care.
About yourself?
Long enough.
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
Then keep your mouth shut.
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning.
I can't.
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
I understand.
Why? He's right in the groove.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
How old are you?
When did you talk to Lula?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
What'd you say?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Muchas gracias.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
In many capacities.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
It has its moments of uncertainty.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
You ain't actin', mama.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
And you never told nobody about it?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
So?
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
You mean like pedal pushers?
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
We got through two states already.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
What kinda trash talk is that?
We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose.
It's just another case, Sailor.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
You do.
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
You think she's pretty?
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
More'n likely.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
Oh shit...
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
Yeah, I'm here.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
No radio or TV...
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Yeah?
Went with Bobby.
Let's leave here.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
Have it your way... But you want it.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Yes.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
I didn't see nothin'...
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
He's right, you look horrible.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
He lives with his mother.
Tripp.
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
His parents.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Do you know he won't expel him?
You did.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Sure.
Yea?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Really? That's remarkable.
So what are you doing out here?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
What'd he say?
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Hm.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Outside Scranton.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Amazing.
Kinship. And what's here?
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
I'm sorry.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
I'm not going, with them.
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Who does?
I got the message you called too.
Is the thing -- is it over?
I'm kidding. Hello?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
That... and you.
Dozens. It's very sad.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
I'm not sure that's possible.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
What's that?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
What is it, Grady?
I'm in love with your wife.
Excuse me?
As a heart attack.
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
If he's happy...  I'm happy.
No shit.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
I'm working on it.
Is it because of Anna?
This little table is one heavy bitch.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
It wasn't like that.
C'mon, Walter.
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
I don't like starlings.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
It's hard to describe.
Robin.
Cop.
Okay.
Fairy tales?
No.
I don't know.
The girl.
I was asleep.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.
But you are taking it?
No.
Banished... yeah.
Robin?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Ev-i-dence.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
No fucking way.
Then why are you talking about this?
I mean, when will I be normal.
Will I ever be normal?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
What is your idea of being normal?
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
Is this the first one?
I want to talk about it now.
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
You mean my problem?
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
I don't know.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Where are you?
In my bed too.
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
What else?
I was six years old!
How do you feel about that?
I'm talking about you.
What's weird about that?
I'm just quiet.
I'll buy a plant.
You must hate it.
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
What about them?
I get that impression.
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
Is that all?
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
What did you do to them?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Why young girls, Walter?
I'm not scared.
I've got problems.
Fine.
Not when they fly.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Piece of cake, baby.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
I'm switching off now.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
What about O-2?
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
How?
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Let's go, guys.
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
I can't... make it... podner.
Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
Then how come you're not with him?
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
At what?
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
Does it please you to say such things?
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
So, you wonder why?
Okay. In a few minutes.
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
I deserve it.
Do you consider that a compliment?
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Ask her.
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
Here I am.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
No. The owners are in Australia.
What boat?
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
Yes, we will.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
Through someone else?
Who?
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
Why?
Of God.
Yes Mother.
Say it!
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Right now?
Yes.
Oh, there are so many.
Do you think he loves you?
Yes.
And you like that?
I don't know.
Down... there.
I went to my room.
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
What do you mean?
Anything?
I can't have them any more.
Why not?
Does it bother you?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
You'll laugh.
No.
Do you?
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
Agnes...
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Her headaches.
Yes.
I really love you.
Because I wasn't worthy.
No.
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Hm hmm.
What else?
Frightened.
What did she mean?
How did she know about him?
Yes.
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Yes.
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
Larry there's got to be something missing.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
How do you survive?
Yes.
I can beat that.
No-one.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
So, someone else could have done it.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
What?
Then help her.
How?
What sheets?
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Oh, God.
I know you don't.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Bullshit yourself!
Nothing...
Do you think they ever existed?
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
My God, but you're determined.
And the baby.
Wasn't it!
They are?
Nine.
I'm a deserter.
Just you?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
Bag-snatcher.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Have I said something amiss?
He hasn't.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Eh, there's only three of them.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
They ought to be.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Of course.
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Out where?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
I'll look after meself.
But I'm clean.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
That's all right then.
That little old man.
Oh, I see.
Foreign devil ...
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
What's old got to do with it?
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
You're a swine, isn't he George?
No.
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
What?
Oh yes.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Oh, leave off!!!
Well ...
Aren't we ...
It's not my fault.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Who?
Nerves.
Shurrup, cheerful.
Well, he can't stop here.
Gravity?
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
What's the terrain down there?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Receiving.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
Take a look.
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
How's it coming on the engines?
I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
No, I don't want us separated.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Don't be an idiot.
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
We sure need this flamethrower.
Is it armed?
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
What's the frequency?
Yes, thank heaven.
Is it still dripping?
Let's get moving with this net.
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Not a one.  It's dead.
Oh well... you know me.
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
We're coming!
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
You win.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
Can we get to him?
No... don't...
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Sure.
Okay, give me the numbers.
We're what!?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
What?
What's wrong?
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Where does that lead to?
Uh-huh.
What's the problem?
You've checked that end?
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
Check out the tent.
I... I can't!
We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
Just some coffee.
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Right here. A minute ago.
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I'll try.
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
Then you're crazy.
She did...?
What?
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
What's all over?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
I will not calm down!
Here we go...
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
I'll say.
You were great.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Just wondered what?
Why.
Why what?
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Everything.
You think?
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
How long does it take?
Oh, no. I see the play.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Not just that way. As a friend...
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
No, Eve, I won't forget...
Please...
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
- an understudy's performance.
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
Thank you, Karen.
Not at all...
Of course it is.
San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Why not?
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
I'm so happy you're happy.
Roughly ten minutes.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
I just can't believe it.
For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise-
Now just a minute-
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
Margo!
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Up in the room.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
What do you mean?
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
She is a louse.
I mean really, deeply angry...
That's right, but I don't understand-
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
I didn't hear you.
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
I was sure trying.
Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb--  --listen, that was a Watergate question--
About the past year.
--see?--
When?
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--shit, who do we know?--
What's the matter?
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
I'm on deadline.
--Howard Hunt?
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Well of course.
That's right.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
--so?
--that was awhile ago--
You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
--yes--
--there's nothing new in it--
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
Give me your checkbook then.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
...No... never in so many words...
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
I'm not your source on that.
--you double-checked both sources?--
You asking me to disclose my source?
--I'm not here.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
I have nothing more to say.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
--yes, yes, what is it?
Security consultant.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
I did all right on McCord.
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
Of course--everything they asked--
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
You talked to Stifler?
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
This isn't any better, Chris.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Sure.
You mean...and orgasm?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
You think she was serious?
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
Okay, well that about covers it.
It's not what it looks like!
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Highly, highly overrated.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
You've got something going?
Shame on you!
God dammit, Stifler!
How?
Yeah, right here.
It did.
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
What the fuck are you doing here?
Yep.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Like an underground club?
So... you feel okay now?
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I know. He told me.
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Well, they are French.
Before the coma!
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
What?
Why the fuck would I do that?
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
Andy? Andy is that you?
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
What happened to your parents?
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Trying... to... breathe...
It's the best fork of all
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
Shut up!
Ew. . .  the honest type.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
I had nothing to do with it!
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
What do you mean, next?
It's okay.
Portchnik.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Well, stop listening to him.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Hey, that was last year.
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
Yeah, I know.
M'hm...
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
I know.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Here, you want some?
M'hm.
I have a tiny apartment.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
No, I'm fine.
U-huh.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Oh.
What?
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Oh. What?
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Okay, okay. Okay.
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
Thing?
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
Can I confess something?
Why are you so hostile?
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Don't get upset!
I can think of another word.
Yeah.
...as opposed to a print...
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
I don't know, I mean, I-
M'hm.
What difference does that make?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
M'hm.
And... uh-
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
But she's colored.
So the colored have enough trouble.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
Hey-
I don't know. I don't know.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Why last?
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
What what's about?
What?
You really need to be fucked.
And?
Monica.
Forget it, Judy.
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Let me heal you, baby.
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
A perfect night.
It was fifteen seconds.
We'll be fine.
Did you invite them?
Just do what I say, alright?
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Really?
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Truce.
I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
Well he can't have gone far.
Otis!!!!
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
That is not true.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Yes.
Ah...
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
I meant Sally.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Uh-huh.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
Sally!!!!
A lot of cakes.
And he doesn't smoke?
Come here.
I'm so sorry.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
Clair is a hovering mother.
Not good.
They're nothing like us.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
Oh?
I...
Oh?
Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you see.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Oh great.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I wasn't finished.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
I'm worried about your Galiano.
I never like to talk about my work.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Would you like to meet my husband?
Yes.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
Really?
Yes.
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
Worker!  Come back here now!
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Let's dig in!
The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Okay, son.
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Oh!
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Of course not.
Why?
You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
Who?
Something wrong with your legs?
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
I'm not very good at it.
You don't have to entertain me.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
No -- just come as you are.
Cheers.
You don't have to if you don't want to --
I don't?
We're going to finish that gin game.
Mind if I come in?
In there.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Gas?
Mr. Dobisch said that?
Think.
Who?
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
No key!
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
So what's it going to be?
No I didn't.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Fran been sick or something?
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Sure.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
What's this -- you packing?
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Well, you can't win 'em all.
I'm with you, lover.
Good night?
Get more coffee.
And what happened to you?
It's been hell.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
Yeah, we better.
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
What are you talking about?
What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.
Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Yeah.
Dreadful.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
Well --
What !
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
Yeah. Way north.
What unit were you with ?
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
A long time.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
You got to kill this sonuvabitch -- Lance and me, we don''t understand none of this -- Jesus, Captain -- I don't wanna die here -- Do it quick.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
Who knows what's up there?
Thta's not Charlie's work --
Signs?
What is it?
Which way? Right or left?
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Would he remember you ?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
Captain?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Thank you, sir.
I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.
You want'a surf, soldier?
What's the furthest you been in?
Can you trust them?
Music?
The trees, eh...
Captain B.L. Willard reporting his presence, sir.
No -- no, sir.
What do you mean, Colonel?
Yeah, I like it...
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
What Truth?
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Yeah... thanks.
When?
We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
What's a big question?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
Yes.
Right now -- I am.
I do.
Son of a bitch, sir.
23   CONTINUED:  
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
43   CONTINUED:
Keep back.
She's dead.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
I was hoping you had some news --
It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
What's going on?
I'll tell you everything later.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
Look, take these cuffs off.  We need to work together.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
It's a spring day...
Where's my ELT?
Shut up!
Nothing personal.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
They'll have to come right past us.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
Huh?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Not bad.
No.
No.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Okay.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
How do you know about my mother?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Now I want you to do something for me.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
To hell with sex.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
I should've danced with you.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Okay by me.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Do it.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
Do you realize that I work at him?
Yo, yo, yo...
Yeah...
Never a break. Never.
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
What is this?
Probably.
What?
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
Sounds like chickenshit --
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
What?  What's okay?
Oh, yeah.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
One hour per man.
Yeah?
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
Until a minute ago.
Someone hired both of you?
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
He wants to kill you?
Yes.
And you want to use me to get him?
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
No.  Just Electra.
Why didn't you finish this game?
Where you wanted to be?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Work.  The things I need to get done.
No.
That sounds nice.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Here?
How was the beach?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
Transmits and receives.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
What did he say?
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
Thank you.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Was she the only one?
Martin.
I waited another four minutes.
What?
Yes.
I thought it was interesting --
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Anytime.
Go ahead.
Can I ask you a question?
Anything.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
Fifteen crowns.
Squatted it.
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
You got my word on it.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Too right....Now the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?
You sure got a handle on that word "we".
Yep, except a name for this place.
I don't know. This wall isn't like the rest though, it's not all that old either.
Don't we have enough already?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
No beer?
Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.
Why don't we go together?
You're all bloody useless.
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
No, the boyfriend.
What?
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
Huh?
What happened?
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
I'm not hungry, really.
Sure I'm sure!
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
Doug?
Ooh, well excuse me.
What? You are crazy!
Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on!
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
Yep, it's all yours.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
How do I know what's being said?
I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
Fuck you!
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
Working....Under cover.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Yeah.
Well come on, sit down.
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Heart be still.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
I do.
Why not?
That's over. Way over.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
It was the only thing I've ever asked him!
Demented.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
You.
What kind of a man are you, son?
-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
No.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
Your father doesn't like me.
Yeah --
Healthy as can be.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
I'm not allowed to date.
I have to get you home by one.
It's only 7:30.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Away from here.
What would you do up here?
The truth. I just left you out of it.
In my back yard.  I lied before. It's hardly started. But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one --
What are you going to -- ?
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
I will.
Better. I was really angry.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
I have expectations, too.
No. I want what's best for you.
For the focuser?
I want to come back.
For pay?
I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
Fine.
Oh yeah.
Uh, thanks...
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Coming, Eileen...
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
And where am I gonna be?
Why what?
Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
Operator, what's today's date?
Ssshhhhh!
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
A mall?
What if you lost your keys?
You did what?!?
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Curious...  Very curious.
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
A car.
Dick? Dick who?
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Is  something going to happen Saturday night?
What did you do to yours?
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Does he bite?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
You like people?
They're okay.
What're you doing?
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
No.
Holly.
Doing what?
What?
Something mi trabajo.
No.
Why?
No.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Yeah.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Well, he didn't have it last night.
Just gimme a chance.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
The door's locked.
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
He offered you money?
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Any time.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Go where?  Where're you going?
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
I have a radio fix...
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
Barton!
...Who is this?
What DID you mean?
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
It's still a little early for me.
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a road map?
Well I...
Well not much.
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going  don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
...Barton, is everything okay?
Yes... Isn't it?
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet  what happened to your ear?
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
So they say.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to 
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on  just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
I apologize, Barton.
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
Mr. Lipnik.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
What do you do, Fink?
Well, some of his throat was there.
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Home. Watching TV.
When did you start drinking again?
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
Catherine Tramell.
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
I thought you hardly know her.
Thanks.
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
No.  Come in.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
What's it about?
When?
You paid $50,000 for your character?
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
Somebody always does.
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
Nope, can't say that I do.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
Why the hell not?
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
Yeah.  I know.
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Are you vice?
Of what?
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
It's in New Jersey.
That's good. At least they're interested.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Do you still love her?
You haven't been by lately.
Just look at him.  Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
They're just words.
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
Yup.
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
 In this corner?
Yeah..
Oh yeah..
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
Your people.
Who's John Henry?
Oh man! Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
Good.
Good. What do you have?
I guess you did.
Party girls? Can I call you?
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
I'm your family.
Basquiat, what did you take?
You mean babies with you?
What's that?
A present I picked up for you.
Pretty much the same.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
You like your dad's paintings?
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I need this?
Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
Alright, thanks.
Hanging on every word.
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
Treat to be here.
-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
Nope, I told her everything.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
No hard feelings?
Y'mean take off our costumes?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
Silent night, violent night...
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
I don't.  So, no.
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
What is it?
There's a lovely inn just down --
Why, yes, actually.  Death and chance stole your parents.  But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates.  For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Just the beast.
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
Can I get some help over here?
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Four seconds from...
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Just ones this beautiful.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
Not much.
To kill me.
And now....
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
Excuse me.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
And when you finally get Two-Face?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
... Very good, sir.
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
That's it?
That's it.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Are they paying you for all this?
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
It's gone.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Holy shit. Holy...
There aren't hotels?
And what did you say?
Tom Jones?
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Uh ... yes ...
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Isn't it?
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
Ahm....
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
Mmmmm...
Well, there is that ...
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Yeah, we should party.
Me first! Me first!
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
My butt's bothering me!
Uh...
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Huh? Huh huh.
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
Yer late.
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Oh, that's nice.
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
I see it. I don't get it.
Cut the power!
Not now Bork.
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
What's she doing here?
At least we won't have to worry about her.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
Not really...  what's this?
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
What about this Beetle guy?
Wait.
Where are your skulls and bones?
... acts like she's thirty-five.
What makes you think she likes me?
Just a hunch.
Is this like a trick question?
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
We're...
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
Life is just... too awful.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
I'm lonely.
Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.
I saw some ghosts.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Gooood!
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Well, I just placed a call to your mother.  She had stepped out but I have some news for her.
Their wedding clothes.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
I see.
... Straight out?
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
Yes, Robert. I will.
Yes, I suppose that's true.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
I wish he were here...
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Yes, sir.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
No. I like this attic very much.
My name is Chance.
No. It won't do that.
I am a very good gardener.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Thank you, Eve.
No, thank you.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
I have nothing more to say.
I see.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
Yes. I like that name very much.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
I want to tell Eve.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
... Yes sir - elevator!
Is his back feeling better?
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
I was given meals, and a home...
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
... Oh, really...
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
No! He's a real gardener!
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
No problem, Chief.
No, sir.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
... Well?
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Yeah. Okay.
May 11th.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
What?
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
I'm scared.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
You've always hated the animals.
Us, of course.
Fuck Maxine.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
It's Elijah.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
I know.
Let me try.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
My tits?
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
Hush, sweetheart.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Why are you being like this?
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
When?
Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Is there dancing?
Do you mind?
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
I'd love to see your work.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
and she is mine...
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
THE WHITEFOLK?
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Don't pay to complain.
Fine. But what would I do at night?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Better ask Paul D.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
She was only-
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
What? What? You talking back to me?
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Shit.
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
Walter, how--
I'm shomer shabbas.
They were Nazis, Dude?
Well--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
Uh-huh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Excuse me?
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
A hundred.
That's really thoughtful but I--
No it's fine, really, uh--
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Maude?
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
What the fuck are you--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
MARK IT ZERO!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
It's your roll.
Okay Dude.  Have it your way.
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
Uzi?
For Christ's sake, Dude.
"Our" car, Walter?
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
But Walter--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Thanks Walter.
Now Dude--
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
Not exactly a lightweight.
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
Look, man, did you--
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
No Dude.
What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything!  What the fuck were you talking about?!
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Are you employed, sir?
I don't know, sir.
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an eight.
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
This is a league game, Smokey!
I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
I didn't know.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Not good.
I'll show you.
So?
From his father, of course.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Scud.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You've been here longer than you think.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
I've been better --
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
I was afraid that might happen.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Sometimes --
Perhaps.
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
But you use blood banks --
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
That's a joke?
That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown.
--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
No--<u>this</u> is weird.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
Whatever you want.
I see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch--
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
What? That made her lose the baby?
--which'd be about ten bucks--
Yeah?
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Just go.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
--Domini!
Fine.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
All the shit that was worth anything, yes. You'd be amazed, though, what you can get free on the 'net.
Why?
You planning on sleeping out there?
At least you still have the tapes.
Then I have no idea.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Who <u>is</u> this??
On the phone. Was it for you?
Door's locked. Nothing there.
Abby... you all right?
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
In the trunk.
What do you want to know?
Going out with Meurice.
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
Sign.
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
What do you mean...
How long did you watch her?
Well what?
Jesus, I don't believe it...
Nah, I trust ya.
Right. Sorry.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Yeah.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey nothing.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
THEN WHAT?
No way.
Sure I'm alright. 
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Shut up.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
I'm glad you do.
What?
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
You've got a point there.
Yes. I do.
This is not my usual Friday night!
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
Yeah.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Goodnight.
Yeah.
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Just a minute.
Frank!!
No.
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
... Sandy?.
Hey Jeff.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
Derek!
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
It's garbage.
Excuse me?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
The coca is my responsibility!
We want some grass.
And I only deal with you?
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
You?
Oh hey, one more thing?
Twenty-six months.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
But you must.  It's the only way.
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
Okay.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Just a friend.
Try the closet.
I love you too, man.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
I'm going to California.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
That's where you belong...
That was a beautiful message.
Tuna.
What is your name?
I like fire.
Where are you going?
Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.
What's happening to us?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
Well, here I am.  See?
You can call me Dad if you want.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
California, huh?
I don't believe you.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Because she's visiting me.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
Don't be such a pussy.
And you believe the NLF?
I understand. What's your question?
Second name.
It's true.
No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
Let's try ...
No, and neither were my men.
To show them to the UN, right?
I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
Because it hasn't all been erased.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
What'd he die of?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Sit down, Frank.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
A little after eleven.
I assume his girlfriend.
Yes.
What did Mr. Marsh say?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
Why not?
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Did you ever see her again after that?
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
-- And what did you suggest?
Cocaine.
No.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
No.
Then -- those are not your own words?
No.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
You know I can't talk about that.
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Sorry.
This is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.
I thought the subject was sex?
Try.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want?
What would?
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
I went out on the boat.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
No -- you're not.
Why?
She allegedly humped him to death?
No, Your Honor.
Really.
I'm always open to learning new things.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It didn't get there from me.
SO!
Well, there's a problem.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
Oh, yes.
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Hmm-mmm.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Maybe it's because I live here.
That must be it. It's a great smell.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
After the divorce.
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
I thought it was funny.
What's he like?
And clean.
Much.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
We got engaged.
You want to go back in?
So what happened?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
Woman friends, too?
But no one in particular.
But it's not the same.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Yes! Hi.
I would love to come for dinner.
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
No. I can't. Not yet.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
Why do you say that?
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
Am I too heavy for you?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
Yeah. It could get better.
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
I can't sleep.
Nah.
What's her name?
What's she like?
Okay.
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
I know damn well she's there.
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
Spooked?
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Damned if I know.
Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
Bones.
Hush, baby.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
We met.
All the more reason I should be here.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
How do you know?
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Bill!  Bill?!
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Dad?
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
You was just doing your job.
But --
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
No thanks.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Save him?  What are you talking about?
All right!  Where's the key?
I think you're fucking crazy!
I can't.  I can't.
Give it to me.
There's no time.
Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
It's impossible!
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Caesar, maybe we should run --
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
This is insane!
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Everything you couldn't.
Good boy.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Where's the fucking money?
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Another time.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.
Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
All right.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Yeah.
Oh, really.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
...  yes.
I'm glad you did.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
For what?
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
I'm just making a point.  You have no idea what you're asking.  How much trust two people need to do something like this.
Do you think you know me like that?
Then what?  Exactly.
He hung it up.
Trust me, Violet.
C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
okay, all right.
Caesar wants me to stay.
Violet?
I thought you were never going to do that.
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
...which one are you?...
What is Treadstone?
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So now you know.
You have your passport?
Sir, you waited on line.
-- sir? --
I need a ride out of here.
Oh, Jesus... 
I know that.
What does that mean?
That's what I'm saying.
No.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
But the police --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- forget it --
What is that?
xxxxxx
My husband's out looking for him.
-- he accessed the account --
No.
I don't know.
...elephoned sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ditioning.
... have a look.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Even later.
Really? - God, how time flies!
Remember how they used to stick out?
What is it?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
Enough though, eh?
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
You're the only person I can trust.
They weren't at school with us.
Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
Them?
Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Why not?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Turn around!
You're joking.
"And your children all gone."
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Don't do anything silly.
Take care.
Information Retrieval.
Really.
Tuttle?
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
27156789/074328/K.
What! Shit!
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
Not now ... please
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
But I could be anybody.
Have you got one or haven't you?
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
Pregnant.
No, no, that's impossible.
She say she in great pain.
He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
I better just go in and see her.
Got a beer?
Just take it easy.
You're going to live.
What did you say?
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Our Lady of Misery.
Not as good as Nino's.
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
I think I'd remember that.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Okay.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
I think the worst is over.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
I need a drink, that's all.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
A medical miracle.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Okay, whatta I do?
What?
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
You're burned out.
Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
What's wrong with it?
And the left side of your face is the good one.  Go again.  And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come on --
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
Yes.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it, Ellen.  Let's call security and get him out.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
Good.
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Did you bring your grey suit?
Yes.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
Okay, great -- good luck.
You too.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
This isn't friendship.
Yes.
Really?
No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's do this.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.
How long has it been since you've been home.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Just a two-second dissolve.
Yes.  How do you know?
That's okay.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Finish quickly.  I don't want you getting obsessive about these things.  Good night.
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
Fill for a second.
I trust you.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
What?
Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
You fucking...
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
A picnic?
Oh yeah?
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
Anything new?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Righto.
Honest?
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
Oh yeah?
I'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n' short statues...
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Why not?!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Just about anything, Walter.
It was.
What are you doing here so early?
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
I do the research.
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
I didn't mean to.
Got carried away, huh?
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
What, Mr. De Santis?
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
I ain't going no place with you!
Turn around!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Hiya Maxwell.
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
Shut up!  You let him have it!
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Wrong answer!  No prize.
We hate you guys!
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Would you sleep with them?
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
You think?  Split?
Let me in.
Which way did she go?
Down there.
It's the news, Buffy.
I do?  I guess I do.
Didn't you get my message?
Water.  Okay.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
Why'd you come back?
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
For the dance.
Come again?
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
I should have known.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Where?
Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
China.
All right.  What do we do now?
I have cheerleading squad.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
I had to test you.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
My nails.
They were vampires?
Fine.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
I'm curious, is all.
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
They don't even have Dolby.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
Thanks.
You're having a fling with him?
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
Why?  Why me?
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
What is she...
Oh, please.
Like you've got a grip.
Except for Prom.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
I am.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
What?
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
Gimme the God damn ball!
Just till I lose.
Get over here.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--
So...Wanta make love?
That's my job too.
Aren't we all?
No.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Never heard of 'em.
We gonna fuck or what?
You missed him!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Annie's a smart lady.
Boring.
Jesus.
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
You're a great catcher.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
What?
If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
We're getting married.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
Liar.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
Yes, you were.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
You got it.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
I can't do that.
Congratulations.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
I don't know.
How did Nicky collect?
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
Thanks, pal.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
All right.
...very difficult to get in.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
Yeah.
Hey, she came to talk...
...to me.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
It's none of my business?
The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
It's me.
Nick?
Well...
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Okay. You come by the house?
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
You've got to stop her.
...and she doesn't always -
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...
I-I'll do it.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Oh, it's so soft.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
...they didn't know what really moved her.
You can't make me stop caring...
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
Yeah.
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
Get out of here!
I threw it away.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
Fuck you.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
Oh, you are...
There was nothing to it.  It was my pleasure.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Now move along.
Yeah. Fuck him.
Carmine left?
For what?
But I'm just trying to leave.
How are you?
E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
I know.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Are you sure?
Hi, how are you?
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
I'll be there.
Nothin'.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Is that what you want?
It's what you want?
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Yeah?
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
No more! You see? Watch!
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Charlie M?
Charlie M.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
I'm positive.
Denying?
I'm sorry.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
Are you sure?
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
Well. I stand corrected.
Why am I still troubled...
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
You can't get away with..
Whatever you say...Sis.
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
Stop.
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
I actually got some memory back last night.
How much?
Enough.
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
Nothing. How's your hand?
You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more.
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
You going to talk all day?
Thanks.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
Theo wants to talk again.
I'm going to level with you officer.
Or relieve me of it later.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
It's taken care of.
Make a "U" and go back.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
You don't understand.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Who?
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Sometimes I paint.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
A price on everything.
You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
No.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
Did you hear that click?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Lucky for them they didn't.
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Yes sir.
The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
You knew about me.
Assure them that you're being well treated.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
You could've hit me.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
The money, Nels ... ?
That's a reasonable possibility.
Only one way to find out.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
Who is this?
What time frame have you got in mind?
Sure.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
I don't know what you mean.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
Negative.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
Take the 405 south.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
Seems not.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Let her tell you.
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
I'm sorry.
What would you call it?
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
What do you think his name is?
Hi, Jimmy.
An excellent quality.
Charming.
It's Dave.
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Not me.
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
Yes, thank you.
No, I didn't --
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
What is this?
No, depends on nothing.
Why?
What you doing here?
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
Will you meet me again?
A little.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Delirious.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
Yes.
Do you like me even a little bit?
More than that.
No. Sit down.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
I'm going home!
Never.
Can't remember...
Do I?
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Aha.
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
It's your decision.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
He's at home.
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
So it's on the street.
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
No. It's the truth.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
No, what's the funny thing?
Absolutely not.
Don't I know it.
What the fuck were you doing here?
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Doesn't matter where.
Like what?
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Depends on what you believe in.
Yes.
What?
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
Yeah?
No.
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
Whatever you say, Jude...
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
That's right.
Oh!
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
Well -- come on.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Look.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Only we call them agents.
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
That's not Carson Dyle.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
May I have a cigarette, please?
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
Me? Why me?
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
No.
The last one, please.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Are you going to listen?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
I don't believe it.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
The money is unimportant.
Here's ten.
And if it is?
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
No -- in my room.
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
I'm Regina Lampert.
Yes.
Charles is.
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Come on. You can't stay here.
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
Don't you understand French?
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
Where?
You took the words right out of my mouth.
What?
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
What are you talking about?
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
But what?
I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
I've never seen him before.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
What's he up to?
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
Ok!
Good.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
How much further?
I'm not.
Are you sure?
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
Daddy....
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Yes.
You're the killed.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
You eventually have to talk to him.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
No.
Ok.
Why?
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Not that I know of.
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Who were they?
No.
If sheep don't count.

Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...

That dog was mean before I met him.

Okay.

He's crazy!
I'm crazy?
You're--?  What?!
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
No!
Oh, no!
How wonderful for you.
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
...-er.  It was your friend...
Yeah.

No. 
Put your hand in my pants.
Oh.
Okay. 


Okay.  Okay.

And Brynner's right on...
What do you think I'm doin'?!
 What's it say?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

BLACK BACKGROUND.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Jake, for Christ's sake.
That's right.
If that's what it says.
A ruler?
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
That's too bad.
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
What for?
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
Just find the girl.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
What's that, Curly?
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
No thanks.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
You sure this is okay?
Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
The apple core club.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
No.
I want the rest of the pictures.
You accusing me of extortion?
And why's that?
What for?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
No.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?
Please call first.
You left your keys in the ignition.
Oh... thank you.
Well, how much would you like?
So you married your father's business partner?
Oh, yeah?
You sure shout that?
No.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Doing what?
Yeah.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
It has to do with my father.
There hasn't been a lot of time.
Then let's go talk to her.
You mean she just found out?
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
How about a plane?
Sophie.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Oh, good.
I cut myself shaving.
Yes?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Si.
When it comes.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
But...
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
But I have to know.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Yes. No.
He owned it.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Apple core?
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She ran away?
Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two  I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!
Then why don't you change jobs? 
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
What's she like? What's she like?...
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
We'll talk about that later.
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
What does it say there?
Thais.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
That looks pretty nice.
Yes.
And the notice?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
It may not be about anything at all.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
Toothache.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
I work at Seligman's.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
You're my wife, Susan, and -
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
Yes, sir.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to.  Hello, Georgie.
I'd like that.
She's going to leave you -
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
That must have been love.
Sure.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
I had a toothache.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's not the same.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
This? How long have you been smoking?
How long have you been a smoker?
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
He went home to change for the big date.
There's no light back there.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
I'm giving him his ring back.
I just told you.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
You don't have anything to do with it.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
You work in a market, all right.
Sang.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
No.
Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
She thought it was me.
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
Yes.
This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
What do you two fight about?
Seven months.
What do you mean?
Oh, my God.
Great story, isn't it?
That girl was vile to you.
Your mother.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
Oh yeah.
You know what I just watched?
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
So?
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
The milkmaids?
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
I don't back down.
Can we not talk about this?
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
She meant nothing to you!
I'm going with you.
I can't close the store.
Yeah, but at what a price.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
And this is what you rented?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Because I'm happy.
I'm happy.
I'm not.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
I'll read the book.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
Like ten after.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
To say the least.
I'm her sister.
Jesus Christ, what next?
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
To you?
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
One seventy-nine.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Veronica.
She's my girlfriend.
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Oh... Can I help you?
I said go ahead.
Why did you agree to come in then?
What were you doing?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Typically male point of view.
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
You're a pig.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
I'm serious...
You sucked his dick!
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Something like thirty-six.
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
I feel sick.
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
...it isn't there. Yes.
It was only a few times...
I don't want Caitlin...
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
That's sick, Dante.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
No, I'm just visiting my man.  Dante, this is Willam Black.  This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
That woulda been cool.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
So, what do you see?
A monkey?
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
I love you, too.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
We'll never know, will we?
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Fine, I guess...
Is it really four thousand?
Enough.
Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
Did I miss something?
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Making things real rough for Hal.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
No, he's gone.
Sue me.
What are you talking about?
Anyone else following?
Where's the rest of the team?
Why?  What are you going to do?!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
There, what's that place?
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die.  How's your health?
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
Get off the radio!
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Of course. Food alright?
Try the wine!
And you, sir?
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house.
How do you do, sir?
Just a manner of speech, sir.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
Well, how are you then?
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
Yes sir.
Crabs?
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
But it was horrible.
Yes!!!
Yes!!!
Fine. Fine.
I just say what the other person would say?
Yes.
I was quite enjoying that.
Good. I'm glad
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
You have, my son.
I've done my best, have I not?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
Yeah.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
Jesus...
Did better'n that.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Then let's have it.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Very generous.
By the way.  Daniel said he was sorry.
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Elvis?
Jesus.  Two in one night?
No harm done, ma'am.
I've been calling and calling.
What happens if you don't?
Let's not get excited, sir.
Who is this?
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
It got crashed!  I didn't...
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
You're cool.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
The trunk?
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
You don't understand.  I mean it. Really.  I'm not up for this...
Lenny, my dispatcher.
No you don't.
Collateral damage.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
I listen to classical.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
She's in the hospital.
Jazz.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
What, no insurance?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
You had to kill Heller?!
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
None of your business.
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
Geronimo?
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
You saved my life.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
I have no idea.
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Never heard of him.
Not this again.
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Okay, I will.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Not today.
What's in Connecticut?
I'm sorry.
You saw me standing alone ...
You knew just what I was there for.
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
Don't do this.
I can't promise you anything.
Top pocket...  Go on.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
I don't know...
Excuse me?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
I don't believe you.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Not today...
This doesn't make sense.
Tell me about it.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Where do you think Jerry is?
Anything happening in there, El?
Ellie?
You know why I'm here.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Thank you?
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
And a hundred mile airspace.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
So who...?
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
That isn't the way it works.
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
Mmm.  Look closer.
-- of Hadden Industries.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
That's what they all say.
The V.L.A.?
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
Make that two.
Prove it.
Really.
What'd you think?
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
Meaning...
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
What went wrong?
Gotta go, Arletta.
You don't know!
Git to work!
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
Hey, Tattoo!
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
Well, whatta we got here?
You tryin' to say somethin'?
Innocent?
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Cool Hand Luke.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
Fear of what...
Gaahhd!  What a <u>cop</u>!  You busted me!  The new one, in the Marina.  She has a police radio scanner. It's always on.  She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again.  She's obsessed.  She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
I never hurt nobody...
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
What Friday?
She's supposed to have it.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
Out.  Where does he go?  Nowhere. What does he do?  Nothing.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
Is there a phone booth there?
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
Lieutenant  Quinn.
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Order Chinese for us and meet me the library?  Anything but beef.
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny little teenager.
Talk to Nikko...!
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Right.
Good.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
Have you seen it?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
You should have gone to the funeral.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Isn't that rather too close...?
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
Hard to say.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
I miss Beast a lot, too.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
It was just a little going-away gesture.
What about the engagement party?
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Paul could pop the question at any time.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Just remember that I love him.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
I'm glad.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
I answered these questions last night.
I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
What if it's got a pattern?
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
What are the delusions like?
My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones.
Break up?    They wish.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Not a one.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Really?
It's sex time.
I got worried. Are you OK?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
How about a dance?
Why'd you tell?
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
I guess so.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
What do you want to do?
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
She's only known the guy a few months.
Sure. Of course.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
No.
I heard about your friend.
I'm really sorry.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
A pass.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
You'll never get out of the city.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Oui.
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
C'mon, Laurant, America?
Good.   I'm good.
-- Super what?
Yes.
I guess we're going to find out.
And the other half?
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Jesus!
No one? Then why is Zero here?
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
I'll be Elvis and you--
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
No?
What'd you get?
Can I trust you, Sami?
Does it really matter what I say?
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Just find them!
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
I don't know.     I didn't look.
Go where?   The police are outside.
You can use my car.
Yes.
Okay.    I will have a beer.
We've got to get out of here.
I'm the driver.
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
God, I want to go home.
No!
They sort of got away.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
Watch this.
Where is it, Sophie?
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
And you don't speak French?
You wanna tell him?
Thanks.
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
The lucky ones.
-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
I have a guest.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
I'm bored.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
Come and get it if you can.
Jen!
You coward!
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
Good.  And how are you?
Fine.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
So what will you do now?
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
What does it say?
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
No onions?
Annie, I need a file.
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
It's only a flesh wound.
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
How 'bout the morgue?
You're welcome.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
Does she have a name?
Oh.
Right.
Do you know what you destroyed?
Take the dope, too.
That's ancient history.
Wrong answer.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Annette Harrison.
You might say that.
I have his journal.
You what?
Okay...
Junior.
It's not really important.
What? Another letter from your friend?
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
I sincerely doubt it.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
It's my house.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
No thank you.
Give it up.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
What?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Fine.
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
I have feelings for you.
Why can't we be together?
Yes.
Where did you say she's from?
Doctor King is my favorite.
Absolutely.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Okay.
What do you mean?!
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
But I thought high school is only four years.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
I look terrible.
I want to go home.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
You promised to let me kiss you.
I'm taking a shower.
Good night Cecile.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
I told you to lock the door.
I'll be in touch.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
No.
Racist piece of shit.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Sounds intriguing.
I'll think about it...
Could you be more desperate to read it?
Blow me.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
I'm aware.
What's your problem?
With who?
Oh come on. For her first time?
I'm not in the mood.
You wanted an answer to your question.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Ronald?
Will you calm down?
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
It's Cecile.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
You will be discreet about this?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
It's the least I can do.
Is that so?
I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
I've already told you, she's not home.
You bastard!
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
Did you ever make a wish?
On the back street  a green house
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
I think I should.  3000W?
You're shouting at me.
But wishes don't come true.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
But I only came to give back the ring.
That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? </PRE><PRE>                                AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
So don't look in his eyes.
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
Maybe they have to pee.
Why would they exaggerate?
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
Guess she never found true love.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
What choice do we have?
Sure. See ya.
So you're Grant's secretary?
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
Knock what off?
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
You never say that.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
Coffee and...
Did you change your hair?
A little.
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
My period? No.
Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
You didn't say it.
No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I don't think you'll hurt me.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
I know. The important thing is that it stop.
No, I said it was our first date.
How big?
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
She's just so... pathetic.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Thanks.  Just some pills.
What of?
Yeah, Iím like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure canít complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this ainít no fucking rug! Gíhead.  Feel it!  All mine!
Spinning backwards?
How will we interrogate them?
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
Just like that?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Patricia Crenshaw.
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Shut up!
Water?
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
What the hell is this ?
) Listen, you little...
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Are you out of your mind?
It's a homeless shelter.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
At a press conference.
He's not.
What?
I can't say.
You're kidding.
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Mind if I sit down?
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
Oh... Okay.
I run a temp agency.
I know. I'm sorry...
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
It's nice.
... Me, too.
What about the intro?
All set.
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
Look.
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
That sounds like a curse to me.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Don't come.
Women swoon!
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
No, I've been calm all my life!  If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
Except sex.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
What good will that do?
It's better than doing nothing.
Knox?!
You going out for the Henley Hall play?  They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Uh-huh.
Dead Poets honor.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
AHHHHHH!
I have something.
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
You have another choice.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
From my father and Nolan.
It's my birthday.
Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Yea, art thou there?
Do you have to quit the play?
We have to make it to the third deck...
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
Who asked any?
I'm not a thief.
Jesus Christ lady...
The "come back" kind.
What?
And what if I run into one of those things?
I don't take orders at all.
So?
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
What the hell does that mean?
Shut up!
Yeah, Sal--
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Get anything?
Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart.
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Oh, well...
Kind of. You didn't know?
I don't know! I don't know either!
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Oh, it's great. Fine.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Right here.
Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
I don't think about the shot that much.
What are you, God?
What are you, hoping?
What do you mean?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
Forget Sal?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got!
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
Watch it, shithead!
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
Right.
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
It's not socks, Sal.
Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...
The fuck I did!!!
What'cha got, Bennett?
Technothugs?
I want this bastard brought down.
Wade's here.
Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Shut up!  Drop it.
Are you a cop?
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Drop it.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Hey, I'm eating.
No, sir.
Not yet.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
No you don't.
Hi.
From over the mountain --
No -- that's for me to do.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
All right, Daniel. Jump in.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Not me! 
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
About what?
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Not long -- now.
There's no joy in it for me.
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Coming.
It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
I'd love to.
Tired?
There is nothing to worry about now.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
I'm serious.
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
Mary! Come back ...
Hard luck -- like me.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Do you really think that?
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
I'll be there, too!
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
The past six months.
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
No, sir.
If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.
What are you going to do?
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
Who are you, then?
Go fuck yourself.
Sounds better than nothing.
That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
Then this won't matter.  LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
See?  You're screaming with the language and all!  A person can't communicate with you.  You become a stranger in your own home...
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Yeah...
What are you talking about?
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
What am I supposed to do?
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
You alone, or you got confederates?
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Don't fuck with me ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
We're bringing in your wife...
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
I can take care of that.
Ah, I know!  You're being very cooperative.  I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
They look like good kids.
Special to me, too.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf...
No, that's all.
You shouldn't start now.
You're serious!
I never been up in a plane before.
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Everybody!  Back here!
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
All right. 
I'm here.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
I said you were never a faggot.
Did Pop come down?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?

I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
Two dollars!  Forget it!
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
Ask Sal.
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
OK.  OK.
That's it.
Sal's gonna be mad.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
He's completely innocent.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Tell ya father he makes the best heros in Brooklyn.
What is?
ML, hold this for me.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
No, just checking.
OK.  OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Your memory is really getting bad.
Trust me.
Lie down, please.
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
I don't know.
That's what I think.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
I'm listening.
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
Tell Vito.
Yeah, I think.
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Well la de da.
Probably because we've never met.
I haven't seen you around here before.
Home school. Til today.
Me too!
Shift to your left.
The principal.
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
Oh, of course.
What?
You take that back!
No.
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
They can't be real.
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
HARRY! Here he comes.
Wanna bet?
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
You're right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack. Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Captain Rob came back?
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
I... found that rock.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
I don't know who we are anymore.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Oh I think you do.
Not to expect you tonight.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not your tape.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
Do we have a deal?
I reckon so.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Yes you are. 
Just like the President.
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
Piter.
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
Yes?
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
My Lord?
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
Is he....?
I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
What is it?
They tried and died.
No.
YES!  My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Ah!  This is very exciting.
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
I never said I could ad-lib...
Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
Yeah, I did.
So why didn't you do it?
Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
I don't know.  Where?
Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
Sound!
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
H-how'd you know?!
Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
I thought he was dead.
So did you get his autograph?
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Toss us out on our ass.
But there's plenty of other parts.
But you used to say --
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
Absolutely!  You see this script..?
I think you're quite handsome.
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
Who?
I got married last night.
The marriage already ended.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
Bela died.
Well you tried --
Who's Dr. Tom?
You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood.  I'm a film producer.  I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.  And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet!
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?
Yes!
You're <u>sure</u>???
YES!  JUST DO IT!
I do.
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
What if--you're vomiting?
What if I'm vomiting?
Look at your face. I had a car that color.
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Sure.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Tell me.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
So he killed himself.
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
Oh my God!
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
What's the difference?
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
It was horrible. He called me up.
Who?
Oh my god! On TV!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Never would be plenty.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
Dynamite.
Go!
I missed you.
Why?
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
No. Who?
Come on...
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
Thumbsucker!
Why do you do that?
Screw off.
Yeah.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Great.
It's me, Ed.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
I know.
Look, we gotta talk.
You know what your problem is?
Me?! That's you!
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
Check forging.
What is? Oh, dinner!
Good?
What does that have to do with... ?
By the X.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
Here, get down.
You're kidding, right?
Yes, I do.
Thanks, Mr. M.
Ethics are...
Here they are.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
My house.
You'll be fine.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
What is it. Tammy?
Here?
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
What's it to you?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Do you enjoy it?
Did they deserve it today?
Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
So you saved her.
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Sure, boss.  Sure you can.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
No!  Please leave!
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
Which one are you and which one am I?
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
What do you mean?
Until he gunned down six people.
Did one of the officers work you over a little?
Believed what?
Man, what're you saying?
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
That's right.
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
What?
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
Decorated?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Where is he?
None.  Call it a hunch.
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Something good?
Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something.
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Showbiz.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Oh Jesus.
Who else have you told?
When can you get it here?
They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
Yeah.
I don't know what that means.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
And you won't. Now move--
I'll pay you.
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
They come after you?
Why?
You sure?
It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
What if--
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
What if--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
The thing is...it really can't wait.
Are you sure about this?
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
You got any money?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Pardon?
Why?
About what?
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
No, sir.
Was he with anyone?
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
Something bad happened tonight.
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
I see her for business.
Was that doctored-up, too?
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
Stacy--
Oh Christ.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
That ain't me.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
It is fish.
Brill.
Why would I--
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
You got a minute?
I <u>did</u> care how.
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
Fuck you. You may have to--
Shut the fuck up.
My shoe?
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Mr. Dean--
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
Really?
Dad!
She's in the kitchen.
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Alright!
Did they take your clothes?
Usually they take clothes.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Into what?
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Just be cool.
Bobby--
I don't know. I mean--
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
I need help.
How can I reach you?
Are you okay?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
We found the originals.
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
Help from whom?  Christ.
Explain that.
Federal Express?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
No.
Then let's assume I don't.
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
What do you mean, poetry?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
He said - be careful.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
You sing.  All the time.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
No, but I think I do.
You don't sew at all!
That makes it harder still.
No.
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
Shall we be all right?
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
Still a car.
Do you have your papers, sir?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
Own the desert.
I told you so.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
You were in Africa?
I can get in the back.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Are you planning to be the exception?
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
And you've forgotten yours.
For?
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almásy smiles and walks on towards the others.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure
I can already see.
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
Are you remembering more?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
K is for Katharine.
Hey! -
Would you like me to?
Never heard of it.
Yes, for your hair.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
Of course.  When?
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
A toddler
A bit of one.
Yessir.
I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
How close?
He's on to something bigger.
Who am I?
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Then don't.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
I sincerely hope so.
So what?
You...you can't.
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Look on the back. What do you see?
I'm not the one to ask...
What's my problem? You want a list?
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
It's---beautiful.
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
It's your mistake.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
I'd taken the Mask?
My job, my rules.
That's where the Mask comes in.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
Can't be too careful.
Go!
But--
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
Black of course.
Remind me why.
Because it pays off.
You know where my loyalties lie.
Call it an expression of trust.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
You're kidding, right?  Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
What do you think?  What's this?
There's more than one?
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
They did?
Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...
Five million dollars?
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
Excuse me?
Oh, yeah?
Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
Find out.
Erin --
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
No --
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
Yeah, I heard that one before.
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
Whoa.  No shit.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
I did.  Both.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
The extortion, the threats ...
I wasn't gonna --
Yesterday.
Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Good.
I think we should makes some changes.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
George!
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
Well I hate it.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Thanks for reminding me.
You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.
I'm just saying --
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
What?
What?
Wow, that's soon --
Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
You did?
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Ben ... Ben ...
I can help them!
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
An Imperial probe droid.
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
Probably an asteroid field ....
What is it?
You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
You mean a man you can control.
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
The entrance is collapsing!
A mining colony.
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
Who's staring?
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
No.
Thanks.
I understand.
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
Well, what now?
What are you talking about?
He'll survive.
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
Time will tell.
No! .... Never ....
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
They're...pretending to dress.
My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
With food?
They look pretty docile.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
Go on now. Do as I say.
You told me he was dead.
Cuervo, look out behind you!
Somebody get off!
What's the little black box do?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
That's the deal.
Locked.
Yeah, I got it.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Are you crazy?
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
So be it, to the death.
It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.
The dragon! There...
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
Not you, my husband?
And you cannot love me...
You, my lord.
Because you and the land are one.
Why?
You.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
Yes.
I see, your excellency.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Didn't who tell me?
No, she was heavily sedated.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Rats?
All right then we've got clean rats.
I just heard them Karl.
No thanks Karl.
Fine thank you.
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
I'm Father Karras.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
About my daughter?
The priest.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
You could do it yourself...
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
Did you know my mother died recently?
No, is Regan aware of it?
We'll see Regan.  Now about those party invitations.......
I found it.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
What?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
Hi Father.
That's good.
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
Withering Heights.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Where's Regan?
Quod nomen mihi est?
Oh really, when?
Last month.
Why?
But deliver us from the evil one.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
I've seen him.
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
No I probably wouldn't.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Are you tired?
Be silent!
Bastards! Stop!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
I don't know.
If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
Give me the keys.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Baker.
They're falling out.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
No bones.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
Jack.
You're their uncle.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
It's me.
It's not family.  It's business.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
That how you see it?
I'm not unhappy.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
I didn't get her number.
Okay?
It's not gonna hurt you.
You recognized me.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
All night?
Yeah.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Right.  I love you, Frank.
He was wearing a suit.
How come I didn't hear anything?
The party's over.
He was just having fun.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Nothing. We get nothing.
What's it for?
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
What're you doing?
Right.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
All right.
All right.
Doctor's orders.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Impersonally.
So run a little longer.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
Nine!
Piece of cake.
Sorry.  It only plays static.
Jack?
Well then ... shall we?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Is that important?
I'll call you.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Gotta go.
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
Yeah.
Downstairs.
For a while.  She left.
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Forget it.
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Yeah... No.
There's always another girl.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Older than me.
... Thanks.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
Only one you've never broken.
Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Must've been after we got engaged.
One last time.  It's important ...
That's what they always say.
Would it?
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
You mean like ... condoms?
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
Oh, that Karl.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?
Im sure you do...
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. Youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
Who did?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Its not Kate, is it?
Pretty much.
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Yes...Jack Campbell...
The Caddy?  Why dont you take your own damn car!
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
I've got everything I need.
Cmon, Jack...
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Need a nurse?
Are we what, Jack?
Okay, youre right, weve been dancing around this for years...
Thanks.  To you too...
I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
And...?
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
That is the general idea, yes...
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Do what?
Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...
Surprise.  Were pregnant...  Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
If you want to look at it that way...
Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me.
Wait a minute.  Youre my wife?
How do you even know about this place?
Now...I dont...
Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
I dont think Id fight you on that one...
A perk for what?
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
And God love you for it.
I need you, tiger..
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
Okay, Ill take them...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Of course I did.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
<u>Should</u>?
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Johnny.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
Sure.
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
You <u>were</u>?
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
The Other Side got to him.
Brain injury.
I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
We must!
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Now I know...
A long time, with one man.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
And if it should take more time to get through --
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
It's too late now. We must go on.
If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve...
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
Don't tell me they're refueling...
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
What about Dr. Michaels?
At an operation?
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
That makes two of us.
We can get out through the Lab Section.
Look at those Walls up ahead!
I could use a lawnmower...
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Where's my daughter?
Drop that fucking money!
What's this, sir?
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
"No." First thing you've said in the last four hours. That's a, that's a fountain of conversation, man. That's a geyser. I mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man. Shit, I'm sittin' here driving, man, doin' all the driving, whole fuckin' way from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to, you know, tryin' to chat, keep our spirits up, fight the boredom of the road, and you can't say one fucking thing just in the way of conversation.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
What the heck d'ya mean?
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Yah.
Officer Olson.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Yah.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
Yah.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Yeah, but -
No, I -
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Stan Grossman called.
Twice.
lot. It's a limited -
I mean a parking lot.
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Well, they're a good outfit.
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...
Nope.
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
Where's Tyler?
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Oh.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
Does this sound strange to you?
This is... really a shock...
Who do you think could've done this?
Can't you give me something?
You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.
Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying.  But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.
Practicing what?
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I want that.
Deal.
Look, this is a bad time...
I'm just on my way out...
It suits you.
When?
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I'm sorry, but I...
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Yes... it's a test.
Who do you think I am?
Now, find your power animal.
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."
What list?
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
What car?
Show-off.
Hemingway.  You?
Okay... Ghandi.
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
It isn't... ?
Look...
I want to know --
What are you doing?!
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
Nothing.
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
She's... you... you're fucking her.
You... you can't be serious about this.
Fuck you.
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
What?
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Not exactly according to plan.
Proceed with remote detonation.
What have you left for me?
My eyes are open.
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
Six duds in a row.
Should we knock?
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Jorge.  When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
Who is this guy, anyway?
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
Sure.
I know, honey.  I just --
I mean it.  Take care of it.
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
Right. April 25th.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
You're the fuckin' devil.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
That's a plan.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
No.
Start over.
Where's your stuff?
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
I've seen worse places.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Nothing we can do, man.
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
Forget it.
Spooks?
Where's his father?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Invulnerable.
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
Why me?
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
I'm not jumping blind.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Typical...
It's not necessary.
American.  Come to get you out.
I could take it or leave it.
Am I out of here?
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
That's it.  My life.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
Well did you or didn't you?
You threw him out?
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
What does that mean?
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
Thanks.
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
I... I was just leaving.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
Fine.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Well, since you're a member, we could...
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Great place huh?
They work for Him.
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
Funny -- you look married.
What's her name?
Well what am I gonna do with it?
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...  ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
So what? You going to help me?
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
You won't be alone for long.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
What are we about to do?
I don't drink coffee...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
You're married.
No, I...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
Well, lemme play the other side then.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
I'm not.
I hope they do.
I'm going on over there...
I love it.
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
You're depressed that I come along.
No, let's go...
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
Would you like to talk to the manager?
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
All right...
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
I don't know.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Tomorrow, then.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
I gave it a second thought.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
You had no inner feeling?
That's right.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
I have to talk to you.
I'll be back later...
What?
What?
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
Aaron, how you doin'?
What?
I, umm, came to see you.
So what's her name?
You got a boyfriend?
That's it?
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
These are the pretty girls you told me to come down for?
No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
How old is he?
You gonna talk to him?
Yeah.
Yo, that's my girl.
So, then whadda ya want?
Unbelievable.
Wonder who his supplier is.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
Fletch.
Ask anybody.
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Not a prayer.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
No idea.
Thought so. What for?
You're in the Records Room.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
My lawyer was a bum.
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Course he has. That's his wife.
Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.
You sure did.
Twenty years.
Wait here for me, Gummy.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Sure, all drifters do.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
Sure.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Not me.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
You are a rich woman.
I ordered lunch.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
I mean put clothes on.
You were in the war?
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
Act natural.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Cabana one.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
Moved out.
I'm her cousin.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
I'd say charcoal.
What about finding the source?
What?  Who the hell are they?
Not really?
Jim Swarthout?
Who's your decorator?
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
So you...
Have what?
But I am...
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
Right away!
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Wha --
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
What?  Jesus, tell me!
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
What a perv...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Ye-ah.
You need it.
And hey, I appreciate it...
Two words.  Disco Express.
'Booty Time.'
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
What's fine?
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
Go on, another time, another place.
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Are you okay?
Julian, you're fired.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
What?
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Where do you want it?
This side.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
Yeah?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Who's this --
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one.
Who financed it?
Who's on him?
Drink this.
Come on -- just for fun --
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
Pour it in your ear.
We put him to bed for the night.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Darling, may I have this one?
Why is it called Hellgate?
Yeah.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Sure.
I love you more.
Okay...
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Frank, this is insane...
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Next time lets put some money on it.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Glad to hear that.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Queens, New York.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Fed up?  Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll, and Baseball.
Uh huh...
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Johnny...?
Sun spot?
Yeah...I think so.
No wait, don't go!
Tell me.
I'm glad.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
She's not here.
She just died, your mother just died?
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Whatta we do now?
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
It's not your fault, Dad.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
Huh?
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
What?
Yeah.  Sure.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
What?
Sure.
Be a man, man.
What?
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
You're Shelly?
In that little thing?
Maybe.
Whaddya mean?
Happy Friday the 13th.
My ass.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Wait a minute. I just...
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
No more.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
Yes, but they released me because...
Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
You need to leave.
June the 19th.
Okay.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
That's all right.  I was just...
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Have a good night.
Are you crazy?!
I know what it sounds like.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
A pizza?!
Jason...Voorhees?
What are you going to do?
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
Nothing.
Nothing.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
Where is she?
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
Am I? Let's find out.
I...I can't...
Yeah...a lot.
It's not that simple.
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
What do you mean???
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
But Rennie...
What did you find?
You are going where?
I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
I don't want to hear about it.
Asbestos lining.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
I say we go.
Where is it?
Had to be him.
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
Our Peter?
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
We're able to surprise each other.
We don't even like each other, do we?
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
It's your best play, Nicky.
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
Is it?
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
She is kicking you out.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
Opening night?
I'm not sure.
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
See, Daddy.
What else?
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
And you've been extremely patient.
Right here. At the door.
It's me. Nicky.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
I lost it. I lose everything.
So what are you going to do about it?
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Matthew's my grandson.
What am I doing?
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Why do you care?
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
Yes.
Engaging.
What?
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
But you're his friend.
Where are you going now?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Yes.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Yes -- I can't talk like this.
It is the work of untouchables.
I am your wife.
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
That's when you take advantage.
So did I.
I congratulate them.
He's "discovering" India.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
It's for the best.
He's right, Maria.  That's right.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
What a pity.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
Luca could still be an accomplice.
This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
Thank you, no.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
It's okay, Eugene.
Any particular reason?
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
How long?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
Why not?
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
I was at home.
I know about you.
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
Those checks take forever.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
I'm not doing it.
Antonio--
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
No way. I've got to get out now.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
After four years and now the question comes up.
It's just been a while.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
Better than I remembered.
Want to cry now?
At least you were outside.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
... and live happily ever after.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
Why?
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
Yeah.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
I did I killed a man.
El Paso.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
Pull over.
We walk.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
No, I'm afraid not.
That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Okay. How many bank exits?
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
Aren't we going a little hard?
What do you have in mind?
Right.
Then you do it.
Not now.
Just... tell us what you want.
That's what matters, isn't it?
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
And you told Brumby?
Was he?
Well?
Why?
I want to talk to you later.
I can't.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
I don't know nothing.
Oh, do you?
Really?
So where are we going, Princess?
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
And what was that?
Was it Albert?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Who set it up?  Eric?
What?
Did you work with him, Keith?
Since when did he drink whisky?
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Yeah.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Get knotted.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
I'm sorry.
Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy.  And who's he?
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
That little shit!
You're a bastard.
Yes, thank you.
No. Are you tired?
I don't want to get rough, do I?
Funny, that.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Yep.
Yeah.
Ha.
You're not seeing me?
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
What?
They came in and they, you know...
Well, they fucked it up.
They killed the goose.
We're stuck with this...
...this shit...
You get a bad month, all of a...
You're on this...
I, I...I...
That's right?
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
What?
Huh.
They have...
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
What did you say?
Is that what I said?
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
...I thought that we were only talking...
That's none of your fucking business...
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Yes.
They stole the...
They stole the phones.
Were the leads insured?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
Where was I?
Was I?
Yes.
Why?
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
Oh, God, I hate this job.
The leads come in, I'll let...
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
...did they...
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...I only...
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
Not lately you can't...
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Good.  Now we're talking.
Can't do it.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
I can't do it, Shelly...
The leads are coming.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
You're so full of shit.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
John: John:...my daughter...
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
Guess who?
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
The monthly interview...?
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Of course you have three days.
What was yesterday?
I don't know.
Tell me again.
She wants her money back.
What, "this"?
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
You hear what I said?
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Your farewell to the troops?
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Yes.
I got lots of presents.
Will you take me?
I can't.
Why do you have to go?
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
We have time.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
Beautiful.
Connie's outside.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I want it met.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
I'm going to the market.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
You haven't heard me.
The baby I lost...
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
Except the President of the United States.
Very impressive.
So, that occurred to me.
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
I do not.
When do we talk?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
Keep them alive.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
I'm talking about Italians!
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
I won't keep you another minute...
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
I didn't mean to...
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Your wife?
Why?
You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
Mornin'.
What?  Oh yes.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
You mean, like posed for pictures?
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
I liked it.  We all did.
I don't like to talk about that.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
No.  I --
Sorry.  Not today.
Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
I was an officer.
Something happened to him?
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
Do I look okay?
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
I didn't have the guts for it.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
What'd you say?
You are much too human.
There are straps in back.
It's too tight.
You're crazy.
Need some help?
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
I just want to watch it, okay?
More your line.
Elsa?
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
No.  But someone you can talk to.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
Quite.
I guess.
You think so?  That's very kind --
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
Fish.
I don't want him hurt...
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
Right there -
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
Something like that -
You betcha --
The other day....
What's that?
Got it ...
You know where the others are?
And there she is --
Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Tuesdays ...
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
I dunno ...
You all right -- ?
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Sure --
I heard you were pumping gas -
You can handle it?
I'm cool.
Toby...
It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
What are you doing here?
On account of me.
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
Oh, yeah.
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
Is he still working here ?
She left...
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Why would I get into that?
Anybody!  You understand?
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
What bag?
Son of a bitch.
I'm just having my last few drinks.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Jezuz Christ!
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Nah.
I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
He heard.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
I hate to do dishes.
I don't want them left back.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
Yeah.
Watch what happens.
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Gone.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
Good.
You could put a pool in that backyard.
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
No, why didn't you fight him at the park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' now, I'm eatin' my snack. WILL  So don't go.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Shut the fuck up.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
History.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
--But--
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
I'm sorry.
Hey fuck you.
It's an integer proof.
I think so.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
Then don't set up any more meetings.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
You too, Gerry.
I live right around the corner.
You moved?
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
I do.
--And confuse him--
Hold on!
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
"Undermine?"
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
--I don't have any anger at you--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
He won't be a failure!
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
Hold up.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
No.
Haven't called her.
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
I guess.
I didn't want the job.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
Look at me. What do you want to do?
It's not your fault.
I know, I know...
What?
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
If you bring the caramels.
Then let's go have some fun.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Then what are you afraid of?
Is that what you think--
At least you have a mother.
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Now I can't breathe.
People done it. If they could, we could.
How many men?
Four.
Women?
Can all of you work?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Say, who runs this place?
Anything like work aroun' here?
Yeah. On my way home now.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Been out travelin' around?
Casy! What you doin' here?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in. 
Lissen, I heard that before--
What's the matter? What's happened?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
No plants.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
I'll walk back.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Okay. I be back a little later.
No'm.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
They killed Casy first.
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
I could hide you, Tommy.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
They gone.
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
We gonna stay, ain't we?
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
So, what are you doing now?
Computer guy.
Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.
Really...? So what?
Then express yourself, Bob.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
What's your business?
You see someone?
Bad people.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
You're fucking psycho.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
Right.
What?
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Like heroin?
Yes.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
That's probably a good idea.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
I just know.
You know where I live?
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
This is me breating.
No.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Like a union?
No harm no foul.
Hard to get good help these days.
I don't think so.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
Whatever.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
That's going to cost.
I'm not happy.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
That's good.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Doesn't matter.
What's that to miss?
Does Chicago count?
I thought you lived in Chicago?
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Yeah.
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
What?!
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
I didn't know I had to.
You were never thirteen, Mom.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
I think they call it a pasture.
Hi.
You're right. Good.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Yeah, you know everything!!
Good.
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
She will if you think she should.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Everything all right.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
Oh, I don't know...
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
You don't seem to upset?
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
It isn't right to make him suffer...
Of course not.
That's what some folks say.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
What does that mean?
I'm okay... I'm okay.
Maybe... look -- just...
You shut up, stupid!
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Sometimes.
Don't move!
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Waste the dude.
Was that her top?
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Roger.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
No.
It nibbles. You see this?
Fucked if I care, man.
Yeah! Sure.
Your slave?
Make it my first born.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I didn't know what was on it.
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
How?
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
Yeah.
Wanna go for a swim?
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
212-555-4240.
Good.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
So?
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
I'm not angry it's just
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Go!
Brady!
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
It's okay..it's okay.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
You bet.
I've got you come on, go down.
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
Fun-ny. See you.
I forgot my chemistry book.
Behind that bush there.
Cute.
Okay. Bye.
Probably Mister Riddle.
Thanks.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
I want to stay here and watch this.
Totally...
Michael's around someplace...
Will you call me tomorrow?
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Well, she's totally not here.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Sure. Sure.
See you.
Why are they under there?
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
What about the bogyman?
Promise?
How?
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
Well, let's hope so.
Yeah.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Right.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Is this your first job?
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
What makes you think we're more interesting?
And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. 
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Really?!
Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Ohhhh!
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Bye.
But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.
Oh, right.
Why?
I can't say anything!
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
It's so late.
I don't know.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Leave me alone, can you?!
Get his wine away.
I am glad to see you.
How do you know?
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
So you met somebody else?
But who?  Where did you meet him?
Oh...
Like-- 
But not you.
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
It was on your shirt!
Yes!
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
You look so beautiful.
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Oh, now-- 
She's going through a really rough time right now.
Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
I know...I know.
Yeah?
Wow!
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
You promised to stay on the wagon.
True.
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, he's such a loser!
Oh!
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
Really?
I know, no--  I know.
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
I hope.
You got it.
Well-well, like what?
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
We didn't hit it off.
How are you?
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Really?
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Really?
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, who cares?
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Okay.
When'd you get here?
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Mm-hm.
Take our literature...
They're offering... 
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
...how are things at the Hospital?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
We could skip the Gavotte.
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
That's what <u>you</u> think...
~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
...these guy'll back you up.
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
...his family has offered a large reward.
Yeah, so where is he?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
...what a world.
First things first.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
...here's to child abuse!
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
I am all attention.
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
Said what?
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
A wonderful country...
You know it?
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Where do you live?
Yes.... yes...
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Because...?
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
...what a lovely perfume.
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
...yes, yes, yes....
Then tell me.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
...no...
Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
Yes.
...yes...?
When?
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
This is...this is...a very special moment...
You guys have been so colossal...
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...

I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
Because you're an idiot.
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Heather? Wha...
What are you doing here?!
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
What?
Pretty weird.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.

I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.

Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?

Can I go now?
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
Who cares!

turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
Okay so... what's the safest place?
Second most common?
Well?
I have my connections
Gwen.
I quit. Today's my last day.
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Zero's a number right?
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
What?
Never to put you in my will.
I only married you for your body.
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
We're all here for you Trevor.
A little? Try unbelievably.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
YOU!
Well now there's a compliment.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
Right.
It was you!  I thought I heard...
Allen?  He... he's okay?
That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
He gives a good report and I walk?
Often, uh.
Mister LaPlante...
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
Bill, I got financial problems and...
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Lie, you mean...
Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts.  You may have already killed him!
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
Bodybuilding!
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
Let's watch some TV.
I'm looking for some perfume.
That would be stupid.
-- a sense of proportion.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
About us.
He'll never appreciate it more.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
What's that?
Stop knowing me so well.
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
There's no card or anything.
How long does it have to be a new house?
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
There might be some extras in the garage.
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
I think it's time I came home now.
This is my house.
We must <u>always</u> count the husband. By my count there've been... four. But I still live in hope.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Uh huh.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
He had to come from somewhere.
No.
No.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
What else?  What else do you hear right now?
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
You always get to go first.
Can you really tell from doing that?
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
Different places.
The past?
Sometimes.
Then take me with you.
Are you a cop?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
Who was that man last night?
So?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
His head.  Someone cut it off.
I don't think it is a duplication.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
This cannot be.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
I'll no forget you.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.
Yes, sir.
I guess so.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
I guess not.
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
It's about Mars --
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
What are you talking about?
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
Give up.
Use more ice.
I got the gasoline --
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
It won't be a problem.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
Mine, too.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
How can we get out?
Yes.
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
He didn't say.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Stand by.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
It's right in front of us.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Are all of you named Jones?
We're okay.
In my room.
Okay.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
I thought they locked you in your room.
I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
Yes.
How do I reach him?
What do you want?
I guess we do.
You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
Excuse me?
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
Of course.
How much?
I don't have that much.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Where is she?
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
I can't, I don't have the men.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
And what will they do with these satellites?
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
Get in.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
I committed no war crimes.
You will tell them the truth.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Very good.
I am always glad to see you Paul.
You have no whiskey?
What is it?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
What?
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
He wants your wisdom.
Homework?
Jean Baptiste!
I tried already. The phones do not work.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
We have been abandoned.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
No, no.
Paul! Then another voice.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
There is one thing I need right away.
Why?
Many times.
The lieutenant wants the register.
Many beers.
Thank you, sir.
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
On the street.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
Not at all!
More to the point. Where's our host?
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
-- what was he doing here?
Poor Mr. Price --
Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
It's not going to let us out!
The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?
Why not?
There's always exceptions.
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- where the hell were you?
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
We're safe?
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
Maybe if I --
I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
Good way to get your head blown off.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
-- confirming everything we already know --
-- no more --
He must've beaten us all here!
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
Excuse me?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
By killing them?
Well then who did?!
She talks to me.
My God, I heard something!
For good luck honey.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Must be...
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
A friend?
I'm ok.
I'm all right...
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
Come back to us honey!
The amulet...
What are you getting at!
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
What's going to happen?
Yes, they are.
There's something through that wall!
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Every day.
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Would you know this store again?
What on earth were you doing down here?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Thank you.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
No.  Thank you.
Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
Yes. 53
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
"You could be swinging on a star."
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
You sound disappointed.
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
Too-do-loo, babe.
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
You're supposed to be dead!
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
Oh.  Well, what's this?
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
This is too bad to be false.
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
Baseball, why?
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
I don't care.
So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
I'm happy enough.
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
Muncie!
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Your i --
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Sez who?
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Watch it, Archer --
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Norville.
Geez, I --
Yes sir...
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
I haven't had --
Not even behind your back?
Get out of my sight.
Oh my God, sir!
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
She sits down.
...adenoids.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
At the Houmfort.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
But you didn't have to come up here.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
I've never heard of a cure.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
But it's so far away...
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
Help me? How?
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
She was beautiful.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Yeah, good.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
No thank you. We should be off.
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
What do you think?
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Classes?
Good.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
What you been up to?
What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --
You know, dah--
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
Mom. Are you ok?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
Shit. You're not planning --
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Major.
Just be careful.
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
My what?
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
You like him? He worships you.
4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
Yeah. Yours?
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
What time is it?
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
Yeah.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Actually...
Do it again.
But there wasn't any...
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
What?
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
You know what about.
No way.
Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am <i>not</i> going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
Huh?
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
She didn't tell me.
You don't know.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
How he must have loved you.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
I didn't realise.
Not you my dear.
What plans?
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
Sit still. It's not finished -
Claudia, you torture yourself.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
Give it to me!!!
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Dying?
The crucifix -
Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
I don't know any hell -
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
NO!!!
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
Well, what a lucky break for me.
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
But it has. There is no more to tell.
No...
Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
What the hell would you call this?
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
Who? Who is here?
Yet. Nothing yet.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Karla! You promised.
Don't even think about it.
No.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
You're okay. Thank god.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
Will you try...for me, please?
To get out of Southport?
Deep breaths --
It beets being on the mainland.
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
Why?
See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
He leave you?
You stumbled into my hiding place.
How's the water?
You don't have to be a jerk.
And do what with it?
I'll go find him.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
But why?
I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
What is it -- what are you talking about?
You have forgotten my last name?
My last name is Pherides.
The General  you don't even know him.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now - I don't know 
No. I mean your other secret -	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Hero?
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
I shall not leave the island 
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
Everything's so simple. I like you.
Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
Why in the world can't you?
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
Then foreclose!
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
What did . . .
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
Our clothes are dry.
It isn't me!
No wonder you jumped in the river.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
George Bailey.
Well, wait and see.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
The Building and what?
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
It will?
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Oh, stop that grunting.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Maybe you were born older, George.
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.
Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
Say, where's Mother?
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Huh?
There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
How do you do.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
The whole town's gone crazy.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Neither am I.
Too young or too old?
Ummmmm . . .
Uh-huh.
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
About what?
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Darling, you're wonderful.
Hi.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
You have no idea what happened . . .
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
Sure, sure I am.
Oh, shucks . . .
What?
I'm supposed to.
Good.  It's terrible.
Shut up.
You're betting what you already got.
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
That one -- from the wreck.  You brought it up, did you look inside it?
Not the drugstore!
Every day?
Sean's still out there.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Did you get any pictures?
Is that what it is?
My ass!
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Okay, so that's it.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Why?
Because they're playing our song.
Nothing, huh?
Terrific.
What'd I say?
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Maybe they are!
What?
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
That's what he said.
What's daddy doing?
I've never been supercargo.
I will, I will.
Okay, okay, coming....
Next week.
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
Power line.
I can go out if I want to.
Coming about....
Len, can I see you a minute?
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
Yeah.  Down there.
Want another one?
What is it, 97 days?
You will.  I'll see to it.
Honey, I gotta go.
Okay, bye.
They just wanted to say hello.
Nothing.
Up.
And leave me down here???
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Here.
What's that?
Yes?
Sounds wonderful.
What's up?
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
Well, that's why you got it.
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... Okay.
Michael, you're not going down there.
Only to myself.
I'm  fine.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Afraid I can't do that.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Believe me, I am.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
She, Mister Hutton.
I know.
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Why you sonuvabitch...
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Don't you dare.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
No, South Georgia.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Five hundred yards.
That's impossible.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Sharks???
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
He needs a haircut.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
You know Overman?
Don't bother Hoagie....
Watch me, Grandma....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
Because....
Then don't come any closer.
I have work....
I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
Where is she?
I can't help it....
You're not interfering, Ellen....
I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
You make sure they come?
Michael!
You check it....
Thank you....
It's not nice to be evasive.
I didn't.
I'll miss you....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
Trying to write our report....
There's nothing to worry about....
Doesn't matter....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
You're impossible....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I borrow it without telling him....
The whole idea is preposterous....
I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
You're the man who drives the plane.
I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
She's a tough lady....
We'll pass around cigars....
What?
When I signed on....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
How come only me?
'Snuck up on me....'
I don't like the song.
Screw you, Jake....
No way....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
Oh, Jake... 
Happy birthday, darling. ...
I'll take care of it.
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
No, you didn't.
Pay me, and I shut up.
Then give me that Zippo.
Why?
Listen to me saying what?
Sure.
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
Of course I would ..
Do you pray?
Pray?
I was married to her sister ..
I wanna be near you ...
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
Whass going on here?
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
No, Sir.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
Could you just stop moving?
Listen to me, it's over.
No.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Hello?
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Yeah, what happened there.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
...my soul or something. _ 117.
I think we made a mistake here.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
He's in the living room asleep.
Please, if I start talking --
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Okay.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I might call you later!
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
No, I'm saying to be --
Good deal, man.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
No, you're --
You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
You wanted smaller.
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
Let's go the zoo.
Funny...   I better go to bed.
I'm scared.  What is it?
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
What's a bad idea?
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Nothing.
I filmed this the morning they left.
Eric!
That one time was just the bumper.
When did you have it last?
He could have died.
Here!
then we should...
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Mine's new.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
This plane can not land!
Back out! Move!
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
The velociraptors.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
It has a broken leg!
Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
I'm her father.
You think this is all a joke?
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
You're sure we have to?
Damn!
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
The monitors are failing.
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
The what?
Say again?
How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
Yeah, I know.
They're not here.
What's that?
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
I know, it's very exciting.
Anti-nature.
Please - - chance it.
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
Hola, bienvenido
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
Yes it is.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
This is a seventy-seven ton animal.  Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow.  Look at it's teeth?  Come here, girl.  This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!
Try to!
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
Why?
You want to talk about this?
The kids okay?
Fine.
Relatively.
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
It's safe.
You're a beautiful big animal.
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
I don't know!  I'm sorry!
That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Ken, we've been through this...
I really think we should go back...
Who's there?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
What are the charges?
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
He wets the bed?
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
No. You've told me all I need to know.
Yeah, what is it?
That doesn't make sense.
Great.	When can you do it?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
Just what you've published.
Did you?
Yes.
Did you see him?
... My ... social situation?
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
-- Eduard --
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
I suspected that he -- well.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
... All right.
He was murdered.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Eight -- and seven months.
Was he depressed?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
Can I ask -- how you found me?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
Then why haven't I been --
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
Amerika for us!
Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
I tell you it doesn't exist!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
The mountains?
) They are now.
Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
Did he come around often?
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
-- We can talk --
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Most of them.
How would I remember?
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
Thanks.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
-- Then you don't need me.
I don't like getting splashed.
Yup.
Right back at the start, right?
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
Mm.
I better keep looking.
Where, how?
Just send me a money order.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
What's in it?
It's in the report.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
Then how are you involved?
I know Tom Grunemann.
Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
He's in his room, playing.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Wow!  French toast, really?
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
That's okay...
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
See you in the morning light...
Sure.  Lots of times.
Right.
Is that really your chair?
What else wasn't there?
Your mom.
Sustained.
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
A heavy drinker?
No.
I don't recall.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
You've been living here, in the city?
Ted, do you love him?
What?
Are you firing me, Jim?
Kramer...
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
But it's not a year from now, is it?
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
I know....I know.
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Things? What kind of things?
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?!  Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.  You can set your watch by it--
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
Ha!  You tell me.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
Thank you. Please sit.
Soon.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
He is a capable man.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
Two.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
Answer. 
Ask whatever you will.
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
Where is that?
In the Americas.
I will not go.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
Is that true or pretend?
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
You have grown up very good.
I do.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
I see that.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
I coulda shot you, you--
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
So profound and fat.
Bastard bit my chopper.
Hey!!
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
They could try to tranq him on land.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
That's probably good.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Night.
You're mushing it a little around the--
Calm down.
You calm down!
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
He looks like a giant tea bag.
You wouldn't?
Take him.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
Are they feeding?
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
I just let go of it.
<u>Apologize</u>?
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Wait.
It's ten after nine.
Yes, well...  famished.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Part of our research--
I'm not even a field person.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
No.
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Sometimes.
Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Starling -
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Thanks.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Dr. Lecter...
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
Reasonably so. Yes.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Ahhh... Why?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
No. Tell me why.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
Thank you, Clarice.
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Did you breast-feed her?
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
Do not.  Promise me.
Yes. I want you to go.
My letter...
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
What else?
You forget yourself!
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
My colors?
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
For this...you don't need to be.
Yeah...right...
Intelligence may not be the right word...
That's an order!
Shit...
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
You screw around like that again and--
The escape bubbles?
I can't see them!
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
That inspires confidence, that does.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
I thought this was a pub.
I don't know what you mean.
Where did he get a hundred grand?
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
No Harry, you can't.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
You had better be careful.
Is that you, Dean?
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
Is there no way they can get back to you?
No.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
There is only three of us here.
Invitations?
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
I mean it's fucking empty.
This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.
I'll only be a minute.
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
You know how much it is, Nick.
You know it doesn't include the amp.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
What do you mean?
--you're going to be on your own.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
They're not going to jail.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
That isn't true.
Catholic school, nasty.
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
I-I can do the job, sir.
I am, sir.
Do whatever they tell you--
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
I hear they're closing that post down.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
Charley Wade.
Yeah.
So is Buddy on your short list?
That's in Maverick County.
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
Uncle Al--
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
That guy who got shot--
He's still pissed off about it.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
My father.
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
Maybe.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
They were using M-1's, yeah--
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
Pleased to meet you.
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
That's right.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Protection?
Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
You have somebody else out there?
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
And Buddy was one of them.
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
We have a murder?
Buddy Deeds--
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
Sam--
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
Well, you hire illegals--
If you spent a little more time training them--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Do you remember the last time you saw him?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
What was your deal with him?
What?
How much you got left?
I'll see what's going on.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
So she tells me three times a week.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
How come it feels the same?
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
I'm going over to the other side.
How 'bout you?
Well, it's a complicated issue--
Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
I know that.
He's gonna find out.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
Nix?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Knew what?
Isn't that French for something?
It's an illusion.
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
I think we make our own futures.
Harry.
Harry.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I don't know where you'd start.
They won't tell you anything.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
I wasn't.
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
You saw this?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
He got up and walked.
So could you walk on water?
Philip Swann?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
I'm afraid she's not in.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
What?
Yeah.  You could say that.
Who is he?
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
And he didn't have them?
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Fuck.
You didn't try hard enough.
I can't... I can't go any further...
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
A couple of weeks.
Yes.
Ok.
How long have you been married?
Oh.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
See you later.
Hi, Charlie.
Really?
Oh.
You're possessive.
I know.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
No one ever tells you that...
John thinks I'm so snotty.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
That's what you said the other night.
Why can't it last?
Hi, Bob.
Yes, no.
Well... have a good flight.
Thanks.
Take them.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Good-night.
Is this a bad time?
Uh, no.
Not all that pasta.
Oh, come on.
Ok.
Do you want I send it to your room?
Why do you have to defend her?
Ok.
Bye.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
Sure.
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
Bad?
Uh...sure...I...what?
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Just me.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
What?!?!
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
Look, John, I'm facing it.
He can see you Thursday.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
He's still at the bank.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
You sure?
Oh, sorry.
Careful.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
I'll take that as a compliment.
Thanks.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
I don't like flowers.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
So she's honest.
Didn't know you cared so much.
You don't look half-bad.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
None of your business.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
What?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Woman...
I never asked you to choose.
What are the doctors saying?
Kiss my ass.
Figured it was something like that.
What do you mean?
Like what?
Wow.
Cause I don't get it.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
Your heart.
So?
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
I have.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
We still have to go?
Uh, your earring?
What are you doing in my room?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Why not?
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
I mean, it's not true, is it?
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
What's Mom think?
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Look, I'm busy.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Yeah.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
Brain and Lung.
Oh, she's fine.
It was scary though.
Sure is.  So why call me?
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
I'm coming!
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Yeah.
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
You won't.  You won't have to.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
yeah, good, ok.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
Can I tell you something?
Just say no.
Yes.
-- what kind?
Have you ever been there?
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
Finish it up without the lip.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
I was listening --
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
I'm sick.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
Solomon, please.  Please.  I am so fucked here if you do this.  This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working.  I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming --
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
...cocksucker....
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Jack.
Is Jack your son?
No.
...Lily...?
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
-- let's talk more about your background --
Muffy -- coffee?
Yes.
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
And that's what you've heard?
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
-- fuck you.
Hollywood, mainly.
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
Where does that name come from?
What name?  My name?
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
These Dogs'll calm down -- you just have to come in --
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
When did he go off chemo?
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
Uh. huh.
Marcie.
I don't know a loud crash.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
Fuck.  I think I'm gonna throw up, I think.  I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
As fast as I can.
Did you tell her?
Was there anyone that I know?
Who?
Two years...three years...
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Well maybe.
I don't.
...No....
I don't know.
You should know better.
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
I'II go....is it...back here?
What's MOW?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know.
Hi.
Phone number.
Mmm.Hmmm.
Yeah.
Yes. What? Yes.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
Go to bed.
God smiled upon us.
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
How goes that favor I asked of you?
He who is not with us is against us.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
You can do it.
The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
But -- what is Porthos doing?
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
To the Bastille.  And death.
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
We go someplace dangerous.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
D'Artagnan...
I decided it this morning.
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Thank you, your Majesty.
Forgive?!
There.
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
What was the end page?
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
Alright, stay on the phone.
Did you report it stolen?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
Right behind you.
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
Could explain why Fleming was there.
He said he was following up some lead.
No...
No.
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
What did you do then?
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
How about Marvosa and the others?
What else is new?
Mind if I come along for the ride?
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Did you have sex with her?
No.  It wasn't like that!
Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
I wouldn't presume to try.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
That's when it happened?
What's the bottom line?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
How are Molly and the boy?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
Where?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
To recover the mind set.
You.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
When I'm done.
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
How far away's the back-up?
What's being photographed?
When do you need it?
In the kitchen.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
It's a surprise.
I'll get my purse.
Are you okay...?
Was I in an accident?
Yes.
Yes...
Yes.
You will tell the truth?
When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
He only bit women so far, right?
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
No.
Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Come home with me.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
You got a deal...
Thanks.
I can't thank you enough, I...
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
Yes.
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
...after a while.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
You read about it, I'm sure.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
Fight what?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Let's walk the route.
That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Tony Clifton.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
It's me.
You don't know the real me.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
DON'T TOUCH ME!
You're a wimp.
So?  What do they know?
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
We are all impressed.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
I used to think you were original.
It's already begun.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
What?
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
What are you doing?
I got you.
Who's coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
Go!  Now!
The Matrix?
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
You -- you're too fast.
What -- what lesson?
She helped you?
He is the One.  He is the One!
What vase?
What?
What do you mean, without him?
That was a long time ago.
Gee-zus.
But an Oracle can.
Yes.
I have to.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
It wasn't fast enough.
Where is it?
Neo, this has to be done!
What are you talking about?
The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
Duck!
He's alive.
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
You sure?
'And with your spirit.'
'Thou art then a king?'
Jewish...
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
And say what?
Thanks for the ride.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
There won't be any this week.
What do you mean?
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
Don't promise...just deliver.
Listen...I'm a guest here.
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
Ok, how's everything going?
What can I say?
Nope...
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
What is it now?
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
Yeah, so things'll be even.
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
And you could care less --
Who?
Of course.
'Goddam party'!
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
That you've been to Susan?
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
But what?
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
I didn't say.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
The dagger --?
Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him.
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what he said.
'It's up to Joe'?
Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
Some spot you pick.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Yes.
Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
Didn't you call a Board meeting?
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
How did you meet?
But she loves you?
No.
Do you love Drew?
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Very well, I'll watch.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I don't mind --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Excuse me?
And I appreciate you, too.
I don't know.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Gay?
'To bed'?
Why don't you get off his case?
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
More than you love peanut butter?
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
'Love will find out the way'.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
You've got a deal.
Are you sad, Bill?
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
Um -- not right now.
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
Thank you.
That's life.  What can I tell you?
The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
Speak up, please.
Please.  Talk to me --
Get what?
I'm sorry --
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
How's that, Quince?
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
Uh oh --
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
So what's wrong with that?
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
Yer damn right.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Then what is it?
I don't know.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
You and 'Honey'?
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
Y'didn't?
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
Whatever gets you off.
Burt.
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
Why?
Just two. So far.							  *
Interested in buying one?
Do you remember me?
Yes.
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
So I just take your word?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
Course not.
Where is he?
What are you gonna do?
I'm not.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
I remember my wife dying.
What are you here for?
Well, that's me.
Did Teddy send you?
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
Thank you.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
What sort of questions?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
I have money.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Sammy didn't have a wife.
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
You won't remember!
Why would I do that?						    *
Lemon or lime?
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
Grieve elsewhere.
Tell them what you want.
Yes you do...
How many?
Show me...?
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Cost less.  That's the point.
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
'Cause you don't lose loads?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Sit.
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Alonzo...
Havana, Cuba...?
No.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
I would never doubt you.
Detective Crockett.
Never heard of him.
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Goodbye.
White supremacist types.
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
You sure you heard what I said?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
You inviting shee-it.
Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
I'm scared.
Yeah.
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Get lost.
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
Listen!
They went out over there: must be some kind of exit.
Ziat!
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
The Hilton.
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
I know.
Not far. Just a little way.
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Yes...?
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
What did he do?
That doesn't seem so bad.
How long?
What do you mean?
What's that?
Two thirty.
What?  You gotta be joking.
Yeah.
Oh we... we...
What?
Maybe he's changing jobs.
No!
What's your name?
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
H-how do I get...?
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
Across both tracks!!
No...
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
That's camouflage...
The scent won't last...
That's why we should do it now.
Oh, Jesus.
What?
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
If you wouldn't mind.
I don't have a title yet.
It's fine.
Perfect.
So you've indicated. Do it.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Have to wait.
Not even a hint?
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
You really think so?
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
I'm glad you like it.
It will.
I'm almost done.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Ahh!!!
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
Just from his agent.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
Oh, I am.  Later..
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
What else?
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
In downtown Sydney for a start.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
It's that time.  Go.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself.  So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
Oh, either way works for me.
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
They've got a book for everything.
So do I.  Sort of.
Damn, you're beautiful.
And six billion in the world.
Sean Ambrose, for one.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Just about..
Oh Ethan!..
It's going to be okay.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
I don't.  No exactly.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Nyah still on the property?
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
They'll kill me.
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
You're sure about this?
We did what we had to do.
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
What?
This whole operation was a molehunt.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
We'll see.
Always.
Right, right.  Good.
I thought I'd take some now.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
He won't be back in a hurry?
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
But, he didnít know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
Why don't you take a look?
Twenty minutes.
The Shawfish?
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
I don't know what you mean.
You're not sleepy?
What's your news?
Yeah.
Johnny Cammareri.
In a month.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
Let me come and talk to you.
Yes.
That's it.
Why what?
No.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
Because I have no Luck!
Me neither.
Oh no I didn't!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
Alright.
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
We're here.
Yeah.
He's coming.
What!
Hi.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
How was your plane ride?
I have no secrets from my family.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Why not?
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Where you been?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
What's the matter with him?
I know.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
It was a miracle!
Definitely!
Absolutely!
I'm a housewife.
Then why are you eating alone?
Yes.
People home.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
Good night.
Yes.
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
You're using coconuts!
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
King of the WHO?
Well, who is your lord?
I am your king!
Oh, please!
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
What, "is"?
Come on you pansy!
Stop that.
Bedevere, my Liege.
Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Man!
... But all the decision of that officer ...
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Be quiet!
Shut up!
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
Why do you think she is a witch?
Farewell, Concorde!
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
Gosh - Is he all right?
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
... and you'll come and get him.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
Bravely ran away, away.
Not down south you don't.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
What?
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
You watch your tongue.
Louder, girl!
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
Of course.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Out of my way!
We --
How will I know what she requires?
If you hunt, you kill.
It's nothing.
I wouldn't know.
For Her Majesty.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
I'm glad of it.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
That doesn't make him an expert.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Yes?
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Oh, several things.
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
What's her excuse this time?
Excellent!
A few days...  When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to gather the fragments.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Cold is good!
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
Your Majesty --
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Good question.  See, that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
It's the game, ARCADE.
I came from the city on the left.
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
Yeah...
We are talking...
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
She thought Benz was at school.
What?!
It's already out.
Put in a quarter.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
You've got the schematics, check.
Yeah, that's what worries me.
Look around...
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
Thought so.
Oh God...oh god...
Wait!  No!  That's not it!
I'm thinking!
But I don't understand...
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
They fired everyone.
No.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
The Cowboy??
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
There is no problem.
I'll speak to someone.
And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
Okay.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
Number 17.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
I don't know who I am.
Call the number.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
And who are we auditioning for today?
Yes, Sir.
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
I just wanted to come here.
This Denny's.
Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Hardly.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Pick with expediency !
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
Not listening !
Why did you build this whole place ?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
The Brooklyn Bridge.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Look...
Yes, sir Mom. 
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
Yes sir.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Good, sir.
He's been expecting you.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
No I am not.
You're paying the bills.
I think I'll see hat action.
You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
We just having our first date when you showed up.
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
Come to the rescue again I see.
Why don't you shut up now.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
Ohhhhh.
I don't even know your name.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
What do you remember about her.
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
Could you hold on for a second? 
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
Of course.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
You're being narrow-minded.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
oh.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
An adventure?
You're a good man Nicholas.
Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
You want me to come with?
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
Is that a yes?
She'll be all right baby.
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
I bet your mom sang to you.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
Good for you baby.
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Okay, sure.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Really?
You can get the general idea...
Any more soda left?
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
In the garage.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
No, no no....
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
How much does it cost?
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
That's really cool.
Chocolate?
Can we look around in your camper?
I would.
Uh huh.
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
What?
Who's that with your Dad?
So?
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
But I have my clothes on!
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Umm, Ummmmm
Just, hurry.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
You're butting in.
You like her.
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
Try less appropriate.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
I was gonna predict that.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
It doesn't say th...
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
Well, somet...
... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
She's too genuine.
Quite the little eccentric.
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
You've been the man in mine.
... maybe it's congratulations.
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
She admits it's her fault.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Come on.
No, those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually.
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
You'll have to speak up.
What's wrong with her.
She's going to rest now.
That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
Your job, huh.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
D.C.
How come?
Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
How do you know?
I don't really know what you're talking about.
No.
Need a ride?
Nash.
Nashville.
The car broke down.
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Yes, it is --
Well, can you tell me why?
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
I don't know who you are.
I knew when I first met you.
Oh.
Oh.
High?  Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?
I see.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Depends on what I'm studying.
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Come on.
Just a minute.
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
No, we never did that
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
You do?
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Ah... Peter Finch.
It's not bad.
Yes, I would.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Are we in a big hurry?
Thank you, sir.
You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback...
What?
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Oh my God!  Sorry.
What?
It's video.
How 'bout Manson?
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told.
Let me have the keys.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
We are.  Your camera.
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
They've hypnotized the nation.
Yes.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Where do the air ducts lead?
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Who?
Wayne Gayle.
Two-thirty. Shhh...
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Slate it.
How so?
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
What are we talking about?
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
Used to be. On the railroad.
I'll smile when it's funny.
So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!
Okay.
Thanks.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Any other family?
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Like hell they wouldn't.
In Birmingham.
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Just for the day?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
What?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
You didn't answer my question.
Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
My kids want me to teach them.
Go on - hit me!
Well, I haven't come around.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Wouldn't have known you.
Just tryin' to be helpful.
Okay.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Don't be too hard on him.
All right, son.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Oh yeah?
I'll be seeing you.
Well, I got married to one of them.
Shut up, Will.
Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
And how do you suggest I do that?
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
No, but it traced me.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
Can you read my mind?
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Jah guides us.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
No problem, amigo.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
How long, Dixie?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
Where did you here that?
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
It sounds like you.
Put the gun down, Case.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
No we don't...
Who?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Oh I know.
Thanks.
It is?
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
Anita, remember espadrilles?
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Okay. That's bad.

Betty.
OUT!
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Are you in special ed?
Hey. There.
Cool. I'll catch you later.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Little known fact.
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
I'm thinking when I'm home.
Oh--yikes!
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
I don't know.
Well, a ball player.
No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame.
For this.
I can't help it.
No.
Why not?
I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
It's not the gas, Dad!
I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
Naw. Just killing time.
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
I know.
Wow...
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
Well, what am I supposed to do?
About what?
Ghostbusters are fearless.
I don't know - a sharp pain.
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
Who?  Who's doing this to you?
Fine.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Hi Mom.
Mom?
I gotta stay up, Max.
Deal.  Thanks.
No, she's right.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
Sure.
I don't know.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Restless.  Very restless.
Thanks, Max.
Thank you.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Oh God.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Sorry.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
So do I.
Doesn't matter.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Remember -- open mind.
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
Everybody take five.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
I've heard crazier things this week.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
No...
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
Cooling down.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
Me too.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Night, night, Honey.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
I'm an actress.
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
No thanks.
No.
Thanks.  Well...
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Hi.
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
Nothing.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Both.
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
I don't know what happened.
What's the thing?
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
The movie star?
I never fancied you much actually...
Da Vinci?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Still, not sparkling.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
The others?
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
Not classic, no.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
She's perfect, perfect.
Is it someone we know?
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Hi...
Two?  That's it?
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Mister Sefelt?
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
Thank you, ma'am...
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
No way.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Welcome back.
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
'K-k-kay, Mack!
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay...
Atta boy, Cheswick!
Me, too...
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Did to me?
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
Lobotomy!
That!
Now, what would I be trying to say?
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
I just started!
Scanlon out!
No!
Why not?
I'm not running a charity ward...
Just wait till you hear...
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Hit me.
No! I wanna go!
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
In what way?
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
I see...
You bet, Doc!
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Time out!
Shhh!
Because I quit breathing.
Shhh!  This way!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Okay. How you doing?
You an' me, Chief.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
Yes, ma'am...
After you, ma'am.
How 'bout twenty?
Bet you ass...
Yes, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
What?
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Your grandmother?
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
Why?
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
Seriously.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Oh no.  Do you?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
If it's any of your business, yes.
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Because.  I know where he is.
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
Hi.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
I can't believe you did that!
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
And more...
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Is he gay?
He's a podiatrist or something.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
I have vacation time coming to me.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
Polo.
Is he looking at us?
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Packing.
Why?
No one's perfect, Kate.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
No.
You said it differently then.
She didn't give me a chance.
Thanks.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business?
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
I wish I knew.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
Hello, Edie.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Man, you were a mess!
I can get home all right from here
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little  I better get you home.
That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.
I really don't know.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested in pigeons.
The things that go on.
How do you like it?
Listen get this straight don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
The Father. The Father.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
I'll find you a priest.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Down to the wire?
What about it?
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
No.
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Then..then what's that music?
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
A situation easily remedied.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
There are others.
Then cancel my order.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
You better hope there is.
Now hurry, hurry.  I will watch!  Your desires may be my pleasure also...Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  You must...hurry now.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
No, thanks.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
Her phone's probably tapped.
I'm a tourist.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
How long you talk to her?
How long were you with the girl?
What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
I don't know.
Whatta you wanna do?
I don't ski.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Wait.  You not Adele?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
How are you, Raymond?
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
I wasn't asking permission.
Why, are you famous?
That's funny.
Of course I am.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
I can go to the bar.
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
What, as a sales rep?
A girl.
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
Why are you mad?
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
Yeah?  She said that to you?
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
Meaning?
Meaning time came, I left.
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Glenn, take the exit.
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
What-- when?
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
Just a minute.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
Off a tip?
Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom.  All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it.  Look at the walls in the closets.  The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
A m-missionary?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Home of the brave!
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
Waitress!  Four beers!
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
Come on!
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
Six P-40's.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
Then wh-where do we land?
I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
God help them.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
He does?
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Don't say that...
I know. Put Scott through college.
Good.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
I know.
I'm trying.
I'll just set it right here.
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Of course.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
What, why?
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
You don't?
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
What a treat.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Evelyn, take her to her room!
Yes.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Please don't shout.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
I'm home now.
Oh. I forgot.
Maddy's party.
Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
I don't know.
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Will you take of f your blouse?
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Well... uh... thanks...
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
I'm not burying him here...
There's a better place...
You never get over it.
He was dead. You know he was.
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Bob...
What's wrong with your face?
Sorry...
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Because they deserve to, Walter.
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
One hour!
We're not skipping this treatment.
That's not what I said.
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm not going to die.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
About my blood work?
We're waiting...
He's upset, he's sorry.
I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?!
One week old.
Congratulations.
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
What's her name?
It's me, you dork.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Thank you.
Beckett?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What?
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
We proceed, representing your estate.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
Thank you.
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
That's right.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
We were satisfied.
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
What kind of people?
You're the asshole, buddy.
Not especially.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
You had one guy "like that?"
Helloooo...
Jesus.
If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. After all, this isn't a conspiracy.
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
Had it with deals.
<u>Listen</u>.
What, you're afraid?
I can't....I can't....
Don't do this to me....
Hey, who?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Probably right.
Like my pistola.
How many?
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
Smoke screen for what?
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
There is no "safe."
And pointless.
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
SULEIMAN!
I'm born-again.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
The best. But we won't need them.
Shut up.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Where did you learn to do this?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
It's probably wrong --
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Zira....
But how long is a day?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Don't bother
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
Read it yourself.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
What about it?
Of course.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
Shhhh!
Which one?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
Yes, Sir.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Where are they now?
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes!
They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE!
What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Nah...
Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
...there's nobody.
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
You don't know.
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
I see.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
There wasn't any plane.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Quarter after one. Why?
I'm different. I like it fine.
Why?
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
They're going to arrest me.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
That, and the fun of it.
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
You-killed-him?
Mitchell was dead enough.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
If I did-I don't-now.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
You mentioned information.
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Fascinated.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
So you're not a cop.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
That COULD BE TOLD.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
Lay off, can't you?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
Thank you.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
Positive?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
I am a fool.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
I'll take your word.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Yes, sir.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
What does it look like?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I told you she's just..
Right.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
I'm not sure I can face it.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Exactly that.
I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team.  What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees...
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
Yes, please.
Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I think it went on rather too long.
And you're at this third stage
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
In radio we're different.
Might?
That'll be fun
To the airlift.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
No jokes.  James is in love.
Mmm...
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Why not sit down and wait?
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
She said that?
No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea.  Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years.  And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London.  I'm not telling you how to run your affairs.  I'm just saying ... I don't mind.  I'm giving you permission.
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
Oh no!
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
'Night.
Thanks for stepping in.
De nada.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
You gotta earn trust.
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
SHIT!!
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
You sure?!
Kid, get outta the way!!
I'm serious.
What are you talking about?
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
You never did know when to quit.
What story did you give to Davis?
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
What, Sergeant?
We both got scores to settle.
The best friend I ever had.
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
He's not really my uncle.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
Sure.  For five bucks.
Stolen?
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
You're joking.
Can I have some chips?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Occupational hazard?
Mmm, I could tell.
Vivian --
Where'd you learn to do this?
Don't drown.
What?
Did you buy some clothes?
This isn't a date.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Any good?
Please.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
What if someone tries to steal it?
Where are you taking me!?
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
No one you know.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Goodbye, Bill.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I bet.  That was our rent!
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Dummy.
Kit give me nothin'.
I leave extras, miss.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Yeah.  Thanks.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
But how can you be sure?
I will never doubt again.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
Gently!!
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
Yeah?
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
I have a little.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
I swear it will be done.
Of course.
And our assets?
There we cannot help you.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
Again. Thank you.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
That would be inconceivable.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Scared.  Can't talk.
Do the books!  Do the books!
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Mr. Bialystock ...
But that's cheating!
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Maybe you're happy.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
Only if we ask him.
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
Nice girl.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Oh, the best one.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
I shall count the minutes.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
By the sacred memory...
Bismark...
The Blue Max...
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
Oh.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
What?
Cash.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
No. I told you, she's confined...
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Money.
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
Casharoonie!
Can I trade in my car and take another?
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
Just what he told your detective.
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
Yes.
No.
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Just wait here?
Yes. I think he would have.
Well?
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I believe it.
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What?
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
Why not?
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
I haven't even been married once yet!
The bathroom.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Please... I'd like to go...
You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least!
Haven't any.
I don't know what you've been saying.
Mother, please...
Shut up! Shut up!
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
The wound is bleeding!
What did it say?
But ... the dogs...
The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Léone.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
You would.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
I won't let you say that!
I'd call it stupid at any time.
So that's the way it is?
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
The body of Joan Gale!
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
Meaning what?
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Get out of here.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Now don't that call for an extra!
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
That's what I said.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
You go in for dangerous things.
Heaven knows. A lot.
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
You're insane.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
A quantum one.
How?
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
What?
Is Rose here?
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
You wouldn't understand.  Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
Good night, Rose.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
What was your mother like?
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
But how would you find him?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
No, he doesn't. Not really.
She's watching the car again?
It's Yankee whisky to me.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
How could that be, son?
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
No, son, she is dead.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Oh. Did you say something?
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
All right, darlin'.
Yes, of course.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
Honey, please...
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
What did you forget?
I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Yes, sir.
I'm not hungry.
Yes, air.
Yes, sir.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
Yeah, I remember it.
She looks terrible, just awful.
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
No, Rose, he'll help you.
It'll get better now.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
... okay... you made your point.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
We'll share.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
That's them trying to kill us.
Wh... what... ?!
Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
Name one.
They shot us all, kid.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
You going rogue on me?
Maybe.
You can't be serious.
Well, sir...
What?
Murderer?  Really?
You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Let's hope.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime.
Gimmie a minute.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
You cannot escape your destiny.
But I had to help my friends.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Wouldn't miss it.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
All set.
Yeah, sure.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Hold me.
You love him, don't you?
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Good, I hate long waits.
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
Here goes nothing.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Then you know why I have to face him.
Never-r-r!
Your father he is.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Yes.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
You're wet.
You know this earth - this person.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Want to come again and stay
Smile and that will mean I may
Oh no no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
...I'm sorry.
Ohh!
Yes, I do.
I'll call your brother.
It's only temporary.
...What?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
'Bout seven.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Is everything all right?
Yeah, I can't beat him.
Paulie, please --
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Paul.
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
One more round.
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
...It's very American.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Don't like yours neither.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
How 'bout some Cokes?
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Ya sure?
How'd you know?
No action.
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
Did you hear what I said?
More like thirty.
Ain't they?
When was they here?
How 'bout a glass of water?
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Great, kid, great.
He ain't losin' nothin'.
Yo, Paulie.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
...Tight.
...No.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
C'mon, ya screwin' her?
Whatta these guys want?
To see ya train.
I thought I was doin' ya a favor -- C'mon inside -- Y'know, my sister really likes ya.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
Yeah...
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Maroon, right?
Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
Surprised?
That's right, me.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
Aren't you the lucky one...
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
Aah!
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
We can't do anything till it's dark.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Yeah?
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Have patience!
The what?
By my heel, I care not.
But new struck cuz.
In love?
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Young Romeo is it?
'Tis he.
He shall be endured
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
Hold Daughter!
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
[Within] Juliet!
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
If my heart's dear love--
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
A most courteous exposition.
Pink for flower.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
What wouldst thou have with me?
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
Nothing.
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
Once.
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
He's company.
Of course.
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
Not exactly.
How did you know?
Soon.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Who's they?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
I don't think so.
To see a man about a thing.
I can do that.
What's the difference?
Well I ain't a cop.
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
But you can't.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
Very ugly.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
Because I don't walk away.
Closest and oldest.
That's a good question.
Do you have a good answer?
What happened to it?
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
Don't lie to me!!!!
I hear you.
Oh, you would have done great.
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Maybe.  Who cares?
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
I'm all ears.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
Shut up, Jesse.
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
I don't know, Booth.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
This just might be our ticket!
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Well you're not getting, either.
I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Well, same ol' same ol'.
You've done without it long enough, ma.
What do you think?  Heart attack?
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
Bathroom.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
I'm calling for back up!
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Ask me if I give a shit.
IT IS CRAZY!
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Who?
You sound like that all the time.
Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
Excuse me?
What's going on?
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
It doesn't matter.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
Fine.
What's a Chinese heaven?
Mind your own business.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
No mu-shu.
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Now that I believe.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Carter...
No problem.
New York City?
The Plaza Hotel?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
I need your help.
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
Did you tell Sterling?
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
I know, but --
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
This is pathetic.
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
That silly-ass look on your face.
I was being polite.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Yee-aww.
No, fish is a PM food.
It's him.
No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
You know him?
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
What are you talking about?
Ambassador Han.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
She's fine.
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
I was trying to find the right time.
After I left?
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
I'm not running.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
I already made an appointment for later today.
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
No.  No, you didn't.
Or a vegetarian?
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Okay, we'll order out.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
And you defending her?
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
Looking for Maggie.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
You're going to be very disappointed.
We'll see.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Five hundred.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Can you fix it?
Missed me bad, huh?
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
Me, either.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
It's probably because you got him fired.
Why?
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
No.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Nope.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
But it's on the water.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
It's delicious, trust me.
And then I'll see you in New York --
Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
What's with you?
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
Thank you.  I love you.
What about the letter?
What are your plans in New York?
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
No, I know that part --
Go home for the weekend.
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Sure you do --
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
It's not that late in Seattle.
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
Why not?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
What?!
No, I'm not, but --
P.  Dad?
So I can go.
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
Stressed.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
English muffin.  How do you do it?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
What?
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I know.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
There she is.
She's going to cook something for us?
It's only ten o'clock.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
I just called for a second.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
Who is Annie?
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
I think they're announcing your flight.
I'm sorry --
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
That's none of their affair.
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
How's it going?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
An American.
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
You are no good to me -- in jail.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
I've had them since the day they were born.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
That's it?
No.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Then leave.
And you admire that?
I try.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
I don't trust anybody.
What does that mean?
Crank or glass?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
Answer the fucking question!
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
The Mexicali Boys
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
They have. But they never found a lab.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Don't worry about it.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
Yep.
You must be a hell a shot.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Nope, he ain't Wade.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
I don't expect to live that long.
Plenty.
Same place we are.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Beasley's dead.
Hell of a mission.
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
How about you take your position?
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Out of the mouth of babes.
But, sir...
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.
Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Yeah?  So?
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Because he's guilty.
Understanding the following rights...
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
I'll take the whole set.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
C'mon, just do it.
Yes.
So, what's your point?
Come on, it's graduation.
Meaning?
Okay.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
Well listen to me.  Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh?  What are you going to talk about?  What do you have in common?  You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Swear to god.
Honey, about what?
Yes, I...
That's right, work it out.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Look at those eyes.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Are you busy on Friday?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Goodbye.
So it's an honor?
No.
Sure I do.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Won't you see me later?
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Okay, bye, I will.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
Yeah.
This is so noble.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
How can I look at you and say this?
You need to study?
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Did you talk to Corey?
I love you.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
No.
The guy with the Datsun?
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
No way.
Hey.
What?
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
I love you man.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Good.
I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
I just told you.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
Wine?
Pistols?
Better this month than last?
Are you losing money?
That doesn't work, sir.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
Where is everybody?
I live here.
I don't think that's a good idea.
It helped me realize one thing.
What?
Tons and tons.
Where is Sidney's father?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
Sid, you don't have to.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Meaning?
And Joel's pre-med.
Over here.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
Watch your back.
Yes, goddammit!
"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you."
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
..it's really about family and tradition...
Gale?
But she's standing right next to you.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
More of a game really.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
What?!
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
A note?
There's more.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Hmm.
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
How is that good news?
Catch him, or kill him.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
What does this have to do with Sid?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
What Rielly?
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
What?
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Do you want us to come with you?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Sure.
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Are you saying she was-
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Hello.
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
Go there.
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
Are you sure?
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
I'm sorry, your voice.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
Where the fuck did she go?
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
Are you serious?
I called my dad.
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Stop it!
Who is this?
It happens. Take it easy.
What's that noise?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
Nah, I don't think so...
Don't hang up on me.
Gotta go.
You getting scared?
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
No...
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Don't do this. I can't...
No...
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
Afraid not.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Deputy... good evening.
What brings you out to these parts?
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
I don't know. I guess.
Yeah.
How is everything?
What about the cellular phone bill?
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
LEAVEMEALONE!
...out at the airport...
...so call if you need me.
Working, thank you.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
Wanna another beer?
I'll be right back.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Are you serious?
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
He was there, Tatum.
It's alright. I'll get it.
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
How's that?
Thank you.
So what?  This victim...
Good.
You know.
It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am means absolutely nothing.  You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
Why?
You'll see.
Oh, don't worry. You won't...
A woman...
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
Hello.
What about sports?
What about them?
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
We put her in a safe house.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
It's got to be.
Bear with me.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
Let's go.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
How do you know all about this?
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
I'm fine.
No point in arguing anymore...
"What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world.  Not knowing that we are nothing.  We are not what was intended."
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
There's no time to discuss it!
I... I don't understand.
I don't see anything.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Yes sir...
By what you preach...none!
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
Just keep goin'...
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
You were born old...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
You've done a lot of growin'...
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Oh...
Whatchu doin'?...
What's the sense in it!
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
Why didn't he make his move back there?
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
I got your boy killed.
I mean the armchair!
Do you have a better idea?
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
You don't remember?
We should leave the past alone.
The title won't do.
Tomorrow.
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
The title?
yet cannot love nor write it.
And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
But nothing is happening.
Nobody knew!
Who are you?
Every word.
God be praised!  Locked?
She is always Aphrodite.
Fifty pounds? What for?
To my weekly confession.
The one who came with your letter?
How goes it, Will?
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
"Out of her favour where I am in love."
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
Be still.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Stand up straight, girl.
Your Majesty.
Oh, but they can!
By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
You admire it?
The same, alas.
Moonlight!
I know how to fight!
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
A literary feud. Quite normal.
You never spoke so well of him.
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Does she say so?
Your aunt?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
A theatre poet?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
Serve.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Can I show you something?
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Now.
After.
I don't know.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
You're sure? There's lots more.
What does it look like?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Parked outside?
What?
-- which is --
What sort of car?
Now?
Did what?
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
I don't thinkI can.
Who?
No.
No, no, it's different.
Oh, good.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Forget it.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Alex.
What?
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
What?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Who said there were four?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Yes.
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
Would you like to talk about it?
I'm sorry.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred pounds?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
No one. I promise.
What?
What guy?
That guy, the one that died.
You must be Juliet.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
Yes.
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
What are you talking about?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
You mean that girl, don't you?
What?
She did?
-- What?
Whatever you say.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
Are you in love with her?
Her?
I guess so.
God, I adore you.
Hungry?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
... just, you could look very heavy...
I am not!
Great.
Yes, Buffums.
What's wrong?
Did you?
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Did I what?
Yeah?
-- what?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
-- sure.
-- we are?
Why?
Why?
Well then what are you trying to do-
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
Wash her.
-- Oh my yes.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- yeah, this is --
You said somebody... who?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am?
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Could I talk to you for a second?
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
I already said hello.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
Where did this come from?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
What difference does it make?
Baby, don't do this --
Did you?
What did you say?
I see.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
Oh, hey...
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
See she doesn't drink too much.
Layered?
Well... who are those guys?
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
I'm not anti-Establishment.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
Have a drink.
Who?
Lester, it just happened.
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Wasn't sure it was you.

I... uh... I... uh... can't.

Okay, okay...
I'll call you back.
No kidding? Your own shop?
Who do you think I was talking to?
Steve?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
Don't be silly.
Well, it's George.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
I'm exaggerating.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
That's right.
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
-- no.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Do you have children?
Have they sat down?
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Yes?
What was the Donner party?
Okay.
I am, Dad.  Dad?
I guess so.
Who's Tony?
Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
Yeah.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny, come here!
Danny!
Do I have to?
Who?
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
Grady... oh.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Uh...huh.
It's about eleven thirty.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Good.
Yes.
Wendy!
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Go away from me.
Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.
Yes?
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Royalty?
Oh!
Yes.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
What if it's some kind of monster?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
I don't get you.
Was it a prescription?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
But Uncle Al! You said-
We won't!
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
What about crack?  You a user?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
You can handle this.
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Oh-huh.
Right.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Pay attention...
Were you wicked?
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Again!
What?
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
What?
Now you.
Experience!  Right?
Give me a C.  A C!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
A what?
That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Mary Clarence!
Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
A vote?
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
But...
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
A hiding place.
We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
We didn't tell you what?
Take care of it.
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
Neither did you!
She's praying.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
We're losing it.
That should have tipped us.
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
But how do we get there?
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
I know. 
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Two days... ?  For murder?
I was afraid of this.
What are you spying on?
... Brom Bones...
Protest to my superiors if you like.
They need guidance.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Pardon me?
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
How could he?
I have others.  All I need is this.
Stay back.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
What was she doing?
What books?
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Lady Van Tassel...
I know.  Hold on.
Take the reins.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
People have put their trust in you.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
What did you say?
Come with me.
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
I... I can't do this.
No.  She has gone out.
Where?
Turn around.  Now!
You are from the Hollow?
No one will believe your lies, whore.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
All right then.
That boy wants me to.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
How are you, Bill?
Well, I guess it's all good.
What you got in there, warshing?
Yeah.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.
Leave.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
I know Albert. We're friends.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
Sarcastic right?  You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
But maybe just for awhile --
What are all them books?
Yeah.
Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time. If you ever want to come by and play. We ain't no good either. Well, I'll see you later.
How did your mama die?
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
All right then.
Yeah, I recollect it.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
It was alive?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Yessir.
You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
I've got a feelin' today.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Did Karl go to bed?
Mama?
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
You better go get your things.
I never was no good with history.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
I'll be dog.
Yes ma'am.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
I believe you. I really do.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
So, you're really going to stay here?
How long have you been standing here?
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
I know.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
Signs?
I didn't mean that.
Will he be supervised?
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
A photographer ...
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
What do you mean?
Slow down, huh?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
It means "happiness."
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
You don't give up, do you?
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
Yeah, like what?
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
And what's that supposed to mean?
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
Huh?
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
And these?
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Baby? And what baby is that?
Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
In Manhattan?
Yeah, that's right.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Eight-thirty.
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
Appreciation for what?
And?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
You work too hard, you know that?
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Absolutely. We would be honored.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
That's it. In a nutshell.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in my closet.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
It seems human.  To me.
You're implying th...
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
...but he found you.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Objection!
Oh, yes.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
Well, why does it?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
I should show them an American?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
Obviously.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
<u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
For the third time, yes.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
Thank you ever so.
The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby.  I ride side-saddle.'
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
You don't see any blood?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
Now you've done it!
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
With ME?
Have I got things to tell you!
I'm engaged.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
I'm not that sick.
What's the surprise?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
What's the big idea?
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
You don't say.
You invest in shows?
Wanna bet?
Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little road-house, down the coast -
Yes, Osgood?
Why not?
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
It's three weeks in Florida -
Why?
You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
No - funerals.
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
Where did he conduct?
Then why did you take this job?
You don't say?
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
You are?
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
What's in Florida?
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Good night, Sugar.
Just my feminine intuition.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
I beg your pardon?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Shell Oil?
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Bon voyage.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
That makes me feel just awful.
Oh, no!
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Have you ever tried American girls?
Thanks just the same.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Me?
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
Coffee?
Who's going to raid a funeral?
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
Why?
I cut myself shaving.
You shave with your spats on?
Yes, sir.
Refresh my memory.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Drunk isnt the same thing as happy, Amy.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Last night?
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
No.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
Oh, hello.
Crikey.
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
So, whats your point?
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Not for a dog.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Brilliant.
Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, its way better to look hot while youre doing it.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
You stand on your tiptoes.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnt be violated.
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
I disappear. Its not about me.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Yup. Thats why you get to keep your money.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnt one of them.
Its my job.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
You have more than one gynecologist?
You pawned it.
Will do.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Where was you, Daddy?
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Same as we -- they pray.
Children, come here...
David, come back here!
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
Yes, ma'm...
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
Yeah. I feel real up to it right now. Come on, David Lee, you and me'll do the loading.
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
I wanta see Nathan.
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
I am the clitoris.
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
I said -
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
What Cartman?!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
AGAGAH!!
I know what it is!
Something big, children.
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
What's the password?
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
For pooping, silly.
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
We can't leave without you!
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
Yeah, they suck.
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
But I-
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Oh yeah...
Oh, thank you.
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Why, didn't they say?
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Taylor, you surprise me.
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
That's right.
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
We have room!  Let's go!
That's right.  Will you marry me?
Try not to think about it.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Where's Taylor?
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
Right, I understand that...
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
That's affirmative.
Can I get you something for the road?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
He's my dad.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
I hate fuckin' opera.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
It's a beautiful thing.
Wish me luck.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
100 years! 
I gotta survive.
No...
I am underground.
What about bowling?
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
SHEILA!
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
What ever happened to just bowling?
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
After we eat, Dad.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
They suspended me.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
He's no father to you.
Uh...over easy.
Coming right up.
What do you want with my dad?
Won't your father help you with that?
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
He's dead Sheila.
Are you sure he's dead?
You're really pissing me off.
I am a professional man.
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
I can't see...
Wait a minute --
I said back away.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Fifty yards and closing.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Forty yards.
A thousand feet.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
What team?
Just worry about yourself.
But sir --
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Edmunds?  Can you copy?
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
I love secrets.
Because when we get down there --
The timing has never seemed quite right.
What?
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Beth --
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
Page 87.  "I could never read that far."
You think, in the sphere --
No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
Something for burns.
Tarazine?
I'll just boost the doses.
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
You tell me.
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
That's when you went in the sphere.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
Beth --
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Leave me alone, Norman.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
For who?  The fish?
I never said that.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Don't be defensive.
Look, would you --
Whatever I can do to help.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
Harry?
Wisconsin?
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
No idea.
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Do you?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Arrived?  From where?
Does this mean what I think it means?
Beth and Harry?
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Really?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Unless it's an act.
You seen my suitcase?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
What?
They never used to send a Navy car.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
Is that good or bad?
Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
You mean I generate an energy field?
What do I do?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
It's automatic.
I think I did.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I'd consider it an honor.
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
You rich kids... are all the same !
Well, maybe you better look again.
It's what I deserve.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
What about it, Diz ?
You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
Your father will never let you.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
They revoke our flight status.
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Zander, no...!
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Good luck at the academy.
You're right. Let's never stop...
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
Alright, I love you.
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
Sure.
Flip six, three hole.
What ?
You used to dance...
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Here in Buenos Aires.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
Not a problem.
What's going on, Diz ?
Yes, sir !
Who is V'ger?
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
May I ask Why?
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
No.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
What answers?
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Why aren't you on board?
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
Tractor beam remains constant...
Go you Huskies?
You bet your life.
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
We got em.  North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal...  Yep, you came to the right place.  Jessie James was the <u>Brother</u>.  Of the novelist, that's right.  That's alright Susie.  See you tomorrow, Susie.
Yes...
And likewise.
Surest thing you know.
...that.
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
<u>How</u>...?
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
Cast stood me up.
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Oh.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
Why?
No, that's true.
...and we could get up every morning...
I'm going to tell the truth.
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Big day last night.
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
What?
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
Uh, <u>look</u>....
She wasn't in the...
I <u>know</u> my lines...
Nothing happened.
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Isn't he...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Bourbon and Milk.
You got to get out of here...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
Could I see it please...?
If there's anything I...
The Mayor's outside.
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
I...
Claire, Bob Bar...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
Yes.
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
I'm only trying to...
I know...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Bob are you alright...?
Well.
Why?
Okay...
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
I'm out.
The girl was in the car.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
...would you excuse me, please...
What did you say to them...?
I don't know.
What's in all the bags?
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
Find the money.
Pay her off.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
There's no witnesses...
Here it is: Statutory r...Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah..."statutory"..."unsupported testimony by the..."  Hold on, Bobby...  You've got nothing, and you know it.  By God, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a...Even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  Yes, we'd love to have you...Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
...the city council...
It takes all kinds.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
It happens.
Because it feels really incredibly good.
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Like how?
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
You have to ignore him.
Yes.
You lost Ben?!
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
Alright starve.
Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Where Ben?
Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Every day.  More and more.
We're not discussing your age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
Jackie, she was five minutes late --
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
To make it easier for them or you?
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
Yet another spaghetti night.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
Fine, forget it.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
Jackie?
Yes?
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
Luke.  Can't live like that.
...it's my problem, too.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Don't be too sure.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
We have the kids this weekend, so...
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
I think so...What do you think?
What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
Maybe he's gay.
What?
Thanks, Scoob.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
It was God's will.
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
He wasn't.
But still, you can't be sure.
I am sure.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Yes, Mikey?
Got a lot of homework?
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
I dunno.
Fine.
What's tomorrow?
I can read it to you.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Say, Ni...
Ni...
Fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
No.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
Who is this?
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Yeah. But not any more.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Thanks.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Yeah. I know.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Can I see what you have so far?
Thanks man.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
Yeah?...
What happened?
He's in there...
You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
Agreed--let's move it.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Did you get that, Kulnick?
That's nonsense, and you know it!
I know nothing of the sort!
That's right, fella.
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Do you recognize my voice?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
No, sir.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
And if that were true?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
I see.
That's close enough, Major.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
How long will it take to receive them all?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
They must have made a visual contact.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Everything still checks out okay.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Maybe the warning system's out.
I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
It was pretty bad, huh?
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
Yeah.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Okay.
Hey, you know me.
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Hey, man.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Play it! Come on!
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Great.
Oh, you were in the band?
Am I fucking him?
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
Are you talking to me?
It's okay.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Oh, So what about her?
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
He is.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
Yeah. So, what about you?
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
I know. It's okay.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
You lied to me.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Nazeer what?
You could've come over.
So you can give me more shit?
Can I talk?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Oh, yeah?
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Of course.
New ground?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Mm-mm.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Mm.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
You're unbelievable.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Oh, fuck it, man!
'Bye, Jeff.
Good, man.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
What?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Really?
For a while.
What do you mean?
Well, what about this?
Get off my property!
It's stupid.
Oh!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
New York, huh?
I'm always serious.
If...
Mm-hm.
Oh, my god!
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Yeah.
What are you going to do? Hm?
Jeff!
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
It's twins!!
Positive.
Spit from your dad?
We're here for you, Diane.
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Bullets.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Maybe we can make a deal.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
Bank branch!
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
Come on.
Close, but no cigar.
Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
What's wrong with it?
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
I tell you this is half sold.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Come on, Joe.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It is not.  Get out.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
You're a writer, you said.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
I wrote that with my heart.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
I need some money right now.
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve.  Where are your evening clothes?
Just follow me.
Who?
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
Great stars have great pride.
This is the right day.
I ran into some people I knew.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
Wanted what?
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
I'm not here.
Good.
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
What car?
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Yes.  Madame.
What is it?
It's what we were warned about.
Western Europe.
It's for your own protection.
You love me?
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
We have to have a long talk about all this.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
She has hostages.
Turn it against her.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I did.
Well, there's several ways to go .
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Nurse!
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
You vicious--
Why George, are you proposing?
I can't help it if men notice me.
I allowed it to escape the City.
As brave as my father. As wise.
Can you create life?
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
Sure. Mate in five moves.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Nonsense.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
I was on Earth...
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Brad?
Nope.  Never. 
Who?
You thought that?
No, thanks.
Me neither...
Call me.
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
Can I help?
Mom and I do this all the time.
What!
Say!
Oh?
I know, I'm the fault.
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
So where is all them half-centses?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
First question got to be "Where."
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
What are you talking about, fella?
You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
Anything.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Where's the light switch?
Where's the handle?
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Who needs Gus?
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Lois, you're amazing.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Maybe you wanted to.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Lois, someday --
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
It's beautiful.
My kind of people.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
North.
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
What do you want?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
North. Keep going North!
Put down Lex Luthor?
Yes, but will you honor it?
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
Yes?
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
I'm sorry.
I'll try. . .
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
What do you fear?
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
Got it? Otis?
I've been on the job.
Not really, no.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Unbelievable.
He may have a gun!
There weren't any wires. I looked.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
You think he's for real?
You're on.
I didn't say a word.
We just take it?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
Lara, please...
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
Twenty-four.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Right on the first guess.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
I guess they are a little odd.
How much do you weigh?
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I guess I...uh...regressed.
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
Ally.  That's right.
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
It turns to steaming piss.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Say hi to Zoe.
I will.
No you don't.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
I'm sorry.
Your kids never cry.
They can look forward to that.
I have to.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
Did they give him special care?
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
It's interesting.
I feel like a princess.
No.
What's a ditty again?
Oh.
What, Mason?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
Oh.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
You seem very sure about that.
No.
Here we go.
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
Don't you want to hear?
Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
Do you have the blood test?
I'm a lawyer.
What time in the morning was this?
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Before the actual accident?
Yes.
Why were you scared?
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Why not?
Don't even try to remember.
It's okay.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
The Ottos.
That's the horse!  Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth!
But of course...
You told him that?
Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?
Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
J.J., Steve isn't...
Can I come in for a minute?
The day that I can't get along without press agents' handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.
Are you finished?
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
What sort of thing?
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Take a top coat.
Yes.
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
See me in my office.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
Like you?
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Why did you call me?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
I can't
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Liquid metal.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
So do you.
No.
Then what?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
I don't know.
But I promised your mother.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
I guess so, sir.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
So, what does the Russki want?
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
Yeah.
I have a duty.
You do shorthand and typing?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Your mother, too.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
What's not right?
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Tough, tough!
You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
How?
And what was that?
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Von der Null?
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
This is absolute nonsense!
Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
One of your people told me.
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
Yes.
Jeez, and I never heard of him.
Right. Claims assessor.
Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwängler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
First oboe.
Come to the office, please.
I won't let the fat kid down.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
I thought you did.
What's it to ya?
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
Freezing.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
My whole life has been combat.
Ticklish?
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Then how are you supposed to get back?
I can't sleep.
Admittedly...
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
This can't be real...
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Where are you going?
Oh.  FIne.
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Get out.
Get out of my car!
That's a lie...
What are you talking about... ?
I don't know.  A lot.
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Stop talking to them!
Originally, Connecticut.
Single?
That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
This isn't an escort service?
Call them.  Trust me.
Why would you say that?
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
How do you know?
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
What?  Connie...
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
There's nothing to forgive.
No, thank you.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
It's different every time.
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
I'm not sure.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
No.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Sam...  Thank you.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
There's a carriage house around back.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Well... we're glad to have you.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Why?
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
Fifteen dollars.
That's why we're here.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
Okay.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Just had to be sure.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
We think?
Why not?
This is un-fucking professional.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
Been to the Boat Show.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
This ain't your lot?
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Did Jenny know?
But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
And that's where you met Jenny.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
Too easy?
You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
Same.
Been busy, have you.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
I might've been away for the weekend.
That's what was estimated.
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
Pushing the legal limit even then.
Only in the movies.
I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
How far?
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
Yeah, I guess you are.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Where else?
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
That don't mean nothin'.
What d'you mean, any happier?
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
Something's on.
You bet.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Ah.
You must know Ian.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Be seein' you.
Tell me.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
But more or less.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
It's OK...
Did she make mistakes?
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
No. I--tell me--
Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
She's a rare one.
Uh-huh.
...You know... who *who* is?
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Oh, don't be a grump.
How did you get into the store?
...I don't think so.
He a good man?
Yeah, the best.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
Uh-huh.
They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
Second chair.
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
His eyes are open.
Uh... you're under arrest.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
No.
I'm in.
Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
Yes.
Behind you.
Whose footprints?
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
All right everybody, hold up!
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
I hope you liked it.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
You're color blind.
Frock's been fired.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
What are you going to do?
How?
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
<i>Fiji.</i>
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
All prop cars accounted for?
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
Amnesia.
Of course.
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
--You never had a camera in my head.
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Sure she would.
That's right.  Lauren.
Saturday?
I think I've studied enough.
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
Yeah, what happened?
How about them?
This is where it started.
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
It's a surprise.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
I know.
I still want to look over a couple of things.
--we need more charcoal.
I think I'd like a little company.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
Truman, stop it!
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?
It looks so small.
There's no one here.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Working with?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
No, they don't.
Yes.
You got some kind of business with him?
What's that?
Have you examined them?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
Not according to the men in blue.
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
You can't.
Your guess?
I think they have that covered.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
Is that what you'd like me to do?
Get dressed, Scully.
I'd been told as much.
Evidence of a massive infection.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
-- of what exactly?!
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Yeah...?
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
On whose orders?
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Yes.
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
Where is he?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
No.
Nothing.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Baked in a pie.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
You don't know the procedure.
What did you see?
You think you can do this, don't you?
Evil.
If you believe that.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
You're sure of that?
I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
Sit down.
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
Do you understand German?
He has a little dog.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Yes.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
Well you read this.
I thought you wanted...
Holly.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
How do you know?
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
No.
No.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
I don't know.
Good-bye.
Can I have that woman's passport?
Schmolka!
When did you see him last?
What?
Him dying like that.
Well, you could say that murder was part...
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
Thank you. Excuse me.
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
I said you win.
Two thirty.
I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
You can help her.
You've got plenty of contacts.
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
Yes.
I understand...
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Suppose I take...
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Traveler.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
What!
Big?
I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
They sound like you.
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
You want it to be an event.
Killing himself.
He's at a home out here.
What assholes.
V'asitem...
I told you, I'm good at this.
Do they?
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
Lina, come here!
I don't know. I just want to try it.
No. What are you looking for?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
You gotta get out of here.
Nothing. Let's go....
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
What about Curtis Zampf?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Female...
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
Listen to me....
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
<i>New York Times</i>...?
Isn't it true?
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Mrs. Moebius.
Why? Why would she?
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
Do I give a shit?
What?
Eat shit....
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
I said that the file is incomplete.
What d'you mean?
The documents are forged.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
You know each other?
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
Have you known him long?
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
I dive in search of God.  If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
That idiot!
How many are, down there?
Noireuter.
Great!
What room have you got?
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
It's okay.
Forget it.  I was joking.
Well... about everything.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
... I was right about what?
Who?
... Okay.  I'll try.
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
... The way she moves.
Why?
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
You sure?
You'll try again tomorrow?
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
Anything.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
It's my apartment.
They're going to send detectives.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Of course, that's what they're for.
Coffee might be nice.
What's up?
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Sure. Why not.
Oh!
Mordechai!
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
He's still working out some identity issues.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
I don't know -
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
Hey  I'm over here.
I'll miss you too, honey --
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
To the eye? Like other men.
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard   Don't you?
It was you.
It's better you don't know.
To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
That's easy. Me.
On his back, I suppose.
That's easy. Me.
Absolutely sure.
Must it?
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
What... What are you talking about?
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Have you got a pen?
Youre mad...
Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.
Leon hung himself...
...You-you spoke to him?
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
I dont.
You splendid bastard...
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it wont be for a couple of hours.
Im sure Ill find a way.
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didnt I hear you right?
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Dont fall asleep with your hair wet.
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
What sort have you got?
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
I see. How much?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
And who does Friedman work for?
Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
So you havent seen the film, then?
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education.
Maybe I dont.
Yeah.
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
Ill be alone.
Leon? No. Im afraid he left.
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
Would you know where I might reach her?
Viens.
Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
Cost what?
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Now?
Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
I thought you were an archer?
Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
Come with me...
Because there's an arrow in your leg.
To be killed in battle?
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
Good.
Sound the retreat...
I tried to.
I don't remember.  Maybe.
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
Scared of a girl?
Am I... am I dead?
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Praying.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
... You look wonderful...
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
What difference does it make where she comes from?
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
What complicated about it?  All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I... I never lied!
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
What signs?
True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another?  There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
I don't think so.
Are you sent by God?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
I need to confess.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
I want to be at one with Him now.
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Who are you?
Just over a year.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
It costs.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Who told you?
Who's recruiting?
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
Yes, that's why I brought it.
Yes, so did the Germans.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
Why didn't you come to me?
Pig!
If you need help...
It's a little cut, nothing.
God forbid!
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
I am... I was a pianist.
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
We're getting out.
Szpilman.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Baines is packing up?
Someone died here. It's tapu.
Yes
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
I just want to listen.
He chopped it off
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Which one?
Mottola.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Good lad.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.
You never do, kid.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You know anything about him?
Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else do I gotta know.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
And?
He'll show.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
That's why he won't know it.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
What are the odds on Syphon?
Who are you?
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
You gonna have a go here?  How 'bout a ten spot on the line here.  The 4-9 been lookin' good today.  Lotsa action on 28th Street down there, too.  Pay ya 10-1.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
I think he will.
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Do you suppose.....  ?
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Don't cry.
Do you think I care
Why not?
Oh, Andy, Andy!
Nothing.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Then what are you hiding?
Oh, thank heaven.
She... she fell over backwards.
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Yes.
She could tell you where father is.
What's he want of you?
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
He's holding out on you.
Rosebreen.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
Just give me a minute....  I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant.  You know I always come clean with you.  Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
I don't like him.
Don't you remember....
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Go ahead!
Good.
That's all right.
No.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
No.
No word at all?
S'long.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
Hello, Mimi.
want to talk to you about something very important.
You're always teasing.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
How many drinks have you had?
No thanks.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Who's that?
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
But Wynant --- ?
So am I.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
I did find him!
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Smart gal.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I've got a lulu -- why?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Mimi!
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Home?
I'm fired.
You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
Get off him!
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
We're at war.
What if I do?
So you can give us away?
Knock it off!
There might be something in there.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
They can't shoot us in here.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
What?
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
We'll find our way!  We'll...
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
You still got a map on you?
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
No!
Well, we should identify ourselves.
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Then I'm a rich man.
What?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
Now you need me.
What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
For real?  A treasure?
Like I said; so?
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Yeah, well, we're not.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
I think we found something.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
What's the matter with you?
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
What?
Don't take anything.
You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.
What?
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
Don't let them separate us.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
It's the end.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
THX and me.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
I don't feel well.
I'll report you.  It's....
Yes...
You should know better than that!
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Thanks.
You the Bomb Squad?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Hey, look--
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Which one's which?
Where you guys at?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Off the scale.
What's wrong?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
"Punks", huh?
Alex-
Maybe she knows your old man.
Reilly, what're you doing here?
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
Look who's talking, old man.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
That feeling won't last long.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
I promised her she'd be safe.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Yes.
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
The type they marry.
Yes, Baron?
Two weeks and three days.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Now just a minute, Major--
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
The fourteenth of May.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Yes!  Now don't worry!
Spanish passports?
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
But, Lily--
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Yes.
Beautiful.
Hair?
Marvelous.
Yes, I would!
I <u>must</u> go.
On the night table.
Mariette!
Adolph J. Giron.
And you expect me to believe that?
Giron...!
About what?
That's true.
Then why did you do it?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
I'm tryin' boss.
Lewis...
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
Rose Calvert.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Well, here you are.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
It is that simple.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
To the stars.
This is crazy.
Could it have damaged the ship?
Right.
Get in the boat, Rose.
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
I can't feel my body.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
I should like to see my drawing.
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
I'll join you later.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Glad to see you again.
Thanks.
Isn't that interesting?
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
Guess again, copper.
We'll be expecting you.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
Lonesome?
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Not a chance.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
My change.
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
I wouldn't be surprised--
Hey!--you're tickling me.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Sure.
I can see you're no gentleman--
That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Yes!
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
--And he has sex appeal.
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
About twelve hundred.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Sure, Sis.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
No...
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
Here it come: one-two-
Better.
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
Ignore her?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
All right, Doc...
There's no reasoning with him.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
What about her?
How would you know?
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
Fortuitous even.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Really?  You sure?
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
You wanted to talk?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
Forget it, Ringo.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
'Least they don't scare women.
But this time they'll be ready.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie Down and crawl or you might get Hurt?  What kinda talk is that? That's Virgil lyin' over there, Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined For life.  No sir, I ain't going No place.  You want to go, fine. I'm stayin' right here and have It out with those bastards.
You're on.
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
I know, I need a keeper.
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Where can I find him?
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
I know what I saw -
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
How is old Q?
Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Step into my office.
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Have we met?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
I hope so.
Think about mom.
He was my father's best friend!
Up.
Trust me.
We blast through.
I didn't say when I want to die -
I was just getting to the interesting part!
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Start the grinders.
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
You come with me -  You stay here.
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
Will you still get the money from your father?
Like a veil has been lifted?
You were in hell?
What for?
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
Just stay in bed and rest.
Well, I would appreciate that.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Hattie is a different person now.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Yeah!
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
Woody!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Not today!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Miss.  G-6.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Are you peeking?
Did I get my package in the mail?
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Have you been replaced?
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Will you quit moving around?!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Toss 'im overboard!
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
Yes SIR!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
Sid!!!
What?!
There's no mirror.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
Didn't you know he made things?
She'll have to learn.
What about school?
Get away from me...
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Let me in.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
I've got a present for you...
Finn ...
In my pocket.
Did you now.
Storms?
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
I don't know.
You do?  What else you do?
Then here's a little bump.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
Not Tiger Woods.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA.  Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search.  The odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds.  We hire drivers with nothing to lose.  Then we throw a lot of product at the problem.  Some get stopped.  Enough get through.  It's not difficult.
So go shower already.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
I don't know, sir.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
Your new friends.
Everybody has a weakness.
But will he be house-trained?
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
Any idea how much?
She hasn't called you?
I don't know what to say.
You won't say anything to my parents?
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
No. On you go.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Did you bring the cards?
Thanks.
Diane.
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Are you clean?
Is that a promise, then?
Unless you get caught.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
It's an interesting theory.
That's nice.
No, I'm clean.
And you might get the fucking job.
Running time?
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
I don't rate that at all.
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
You're all hear.
That's tough.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
No, I don't think so.
Six weeks.
That's fair enough.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
It could. Yes.
Then I shall make use of this starship.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
The power was within you.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
If we could send a distress signal...
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Are we leaving, Captain?
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Why?
Fascinating.
Damn.  Let's go.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
I gotta sit down.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
Fire the rockets!
Welcome aboard, Captain.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?


  

No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Sybok, we must find a way...
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
They'll start to soon enough.
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
Oh. Anything else?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
The Pentagon?
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
We have to talk.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
The Users...you really think they're still there?
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
It's something Users do.
I have a book report.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
What?
No way.  Not Dana.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
In her dreams.
You want me to just hang-- ?
She's having an affair.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
So, it was your first time.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
What did you tell him?
They said you had to run out.
Well, maybe a little.
Why?
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
What about Juno?
No.  But I wanted to.
Yes.
So what's your angle?
What about the husbands?
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
He said he was an American agent.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Yes.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
We're going to Paris?
Find out who this Renquist it.
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
His wife.
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
How long have you worked here?
Almost four years.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
So he really loved her?
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
Who and what is a Drexl?
Uh-huh.
I don't believe so.
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
How come?
Why Cancoon?
Take that shit somewhere else.
Live with what?
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
Yeah.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
Get the fuck outta here!
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Elliot.
In case of what?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Three kung fu movies.
No. No you're not.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
What?
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
I don't believe you.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
Step inside.
Thank you.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
You do.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
No way, JosÈ.
Put it in your pants.
Uh, I didn't hear the...
Uh, what?
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
I have to go.
What year is it?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
You know -- your plan.
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
What...???
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
That's 'cause he's dead.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
I won't hold my breath.
You afraid of the dark?
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Yeah.  Just a little short. Figures.  I just wanted to get out, that's all.
Time.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
You son of a bitch!
You've been there?
Two-hundred.
Yeah, but it was shot.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Genuine Draft?
Yes.  Yes it is.
There's someone in the house.
The wind isn't blowing.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
What do you do anyway?
Those are white words, not ours.
Like you.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my fortune.  Thanks for the lemonade.
Still playing?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
I'm guessing no.
I don't know how.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
I wanted to talk.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Because I know you're full of shit.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
Funny thing.
What?
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
Now what?
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
Live there?
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
Just ran into a little trouble.
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
About what you said this morning.
You're talking like a mad man.
You meant it.
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
No.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
It's the truth, Jake.
Christ, Jake, please--
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
I've had time to get over it.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
What happened?
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Nope.  No problems up the road.
I don't understand what the--
What for?
I didn't do anything.
Soda.  You know.
But, Senor--
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
You know I won't be seeing you.
Stand up.
Grace, tell him.
Yeah...
I'm a solid man.
Bobby Cooper.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
Wait a second--
Talk?  About what?
About what you said this morning.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
And tell her what?
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Got any requests?
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
What sign?
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
I want my car.
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
I'm just going to my car?
Nothing like a little liveliness.
I don't know how.
Try me.
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
But I thought --
<u>I don't know why</u>!
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Harlin's.
Where to?
How much?
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Is Noel in?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
Oh shit...
out again?
It's finished. I won.
You assumed wrong.
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
What things?
No.
No Jeremy.
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Forget why. Do you want it or not?
Where is it?
Innocent of what?
We was... lyin'.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Advances?
You want... a free one.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
Those cowboys messin' him up?
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
Property.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
But he was called...
And?
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
About what?
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
Jesus!
Oh.
No.
Well... I don't recollect.
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
I could tell you who was last, mister.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
You ain't like that no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Tom?
The Kid, yeah...
K-k-kill somebody?
Yeah.
How many you killed, Kid?
Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife.
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
Yeah?
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
They'll never stop.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Umm ...
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
I can run. I got no problem with that.
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
You okay?
Mr. Soze will be most -
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
I'11 find him.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
But Keaton...
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Yes.
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth.  He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye.  You meet him at the hospital.'
What does it mean?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Well, many reasons, actually...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Just as you are, Sir...
I know of him.
How is that?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Nothing further, your Honor.
Yes.
That's not my handwriting.
You've just said you signed it.
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
Hold on a second.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
...What difference would...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
... and you're going to do that?
Why?
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
That happens.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
What happened...?
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
Not if you don't grow up...
You, you don't under...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure.
I have to talk to you.
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Right.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to get laid.
Oh shit, what's today?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I'm going to see you get that chance.
You live in the neighborhood?
Who told you that?
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Me, too.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
No.
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
About three years.
Salina, Kansas!
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Tomorrow morning.
I'll take care of you.
Please! And don't look at me.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
They're none of them right.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
No, Ernie's is fine.
But why? Why here?
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
What are you going to do?
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
Do you remember where you were?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Here with you.
Long ago...
No, don't ask me!
What?!
Vaguely...
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
No, never!
Let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
Oh, yes!
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
Would you please go and look?
What car?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
It's where you belong.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
My... the acrophobia.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Pop Leibel.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Just wander.
Where?
Around.
Yeah.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Can we have it by tonight?
Excellent.
I said how's it going?
I don't know why the floor was wet!
It's sacrilegious.
The hell I don't.
You're a loser.
You go home!
What do you think you are doing?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
There's more.
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
I am not flexible on this.
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
It has worked.
They're driving me nuts!
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
Are you solid with that?
What happened? Oh my God...
What.
Doing the bachelor party thing?
I'm not talking to you?
Give me two more.
I can't.
I'm talking about prayer.
What did you ask me?
Exactly! Exactly my point.
I don't know...
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
It's my fucking opinion.
The hell you didn't!
New king.
There's my point exactly.
You said nobody would miss her.
I think so.
Caterer?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
What else have you forgot?
What?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
Why? What's his problem?
What kind of seats can we have?
I need your help.
Do you love me?
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Take care of those chairs.
Of course.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Hey. It's me.
What okay?
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
Well, can you come back inside?
Okay. Okay.
Yes.
Don't even.
Do you love me?
What?
What kind of stupid question is that?
What money?
Move the bodies.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Have another drink.
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
Greenpeace.
Greenpeace?
All week long.
Okay boys, smile!
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?
No, the children sleep with me.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
Yes.
Fifteen yards.
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
What's he called?
Yes -- very, very big!
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
Today, a good girl.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
I wish we could hear them.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
What about them?
On my life, I promise you I will.
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
You think he's smart?
I need your help--
Not from in here.
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
What did you find out?
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
Do I get to see it or not?
I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
Turn it down!
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
I think I understand what you have in mind...
A little less than yesterday.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
What happened when he was 17?
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
For Schumann.
No, this is great.
...but the President wonders about the Possible Albanian Backlash...
What can it hurt is they offend me.
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"
What rig?
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
And you?
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
What's it gonna cost? 
The American "people"?
...but...
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
What do you know about them?
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
Get on this, right now...
...they just hadn't thought it through...
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
How's your wife?
Never quit a winner.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
Quite touching.
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
S'only got to hold for another few days.
To preserve their Way of Life.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
When's he coming back...?
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
...uh ... No, that's...
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
Why would they want that?
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Mmm.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
You've <u>got</u> something, there...
Get on your feet, boy.
We're going home.  We're going home together...
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
No.  You're right.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
Why are they ...
Leopard Skin...
Fine.  Good.
A beret.
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
...for the beans, yes...
Lemme talk to him.  Shoe?  Shoe...?  You in there...?
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
It concerns his future!
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Then get out and close it behind you.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
Sell?
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Speak English will ya.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad...
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
We are?
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
All right, Bud... let's do it.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
What? How do you know about my father?
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
What makes you think you can?
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
You got it, G.G.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
Yeah, yeah, OK
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
Would you like a closer look?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
And uh, your nicotine sir
Thank you
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
I know what you mean.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Big deal!
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Maybe before the event, never after.
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.
Mm-hmm.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
You think you influenced her?
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
I don't know.
I can't, no, no, I can't...
I've never even met you.
This fence...it's so...
Right.  I'm sorry.
And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
What?
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
I didn't sleep with him.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Jody--
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
What?
Please.  That's all I need.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
I was down in Adamant...
What is it?
Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Not the focus.
Why?
It's what I've been working for.
Unless you need me to come home...
Of course.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
Really big bed.
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
Stop...
...Please stop...
What's the matter?
I never asked you to quit!
She's gone.
What?
She can't be here without me.
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Adamant.
I'm cooking you dinner.
I don't believe you.
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
But you've not told Michael.
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
Rowan.
I want to see my mother.
Nothing worse than a common tool.
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Like this...?
Go away!  I don't want you here.
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
And whose houses do you design...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
You still feel that crazy...?
Captain's orders.
Rowan...?
I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
Your beneficence.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
You bastard!
You really love this guy...?
He's got great hands.
Is that what you were doing...?
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
So there is only one key...
No - not all the time - I mean
I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
Yes - I have had it for years.
Sure...
The touch?
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
What did you do with her?
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
Out - I may be some time
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
No - I'll have you after
At home alone - where were you?
I think you had better leave
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
That's crazy talk.
Astronomical.
I better go, Dad.
Check it out!
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
We reinvented ourselves.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
You have changed since second grade.
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
We love our lives just the way they are.
Just say it, Dad.
Well, good. Every little bit helps.
Watch your tone, mister.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Want a lesson?
I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
I guess.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
To the best hiding place in the world.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
He phoned it in.
I see.
I doubt it.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
Tell me more.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
I'll make you very proud.
Oh. Goodness.
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Of course I like girls.
Seldom? No kidding?
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
Me? The King of Coitus?
I was like a different person tonight.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
Eat a power bar.
Kelly.
Thanks.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Where's the body?
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
What?
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
Sam!  Hi!
No thanks to you.
I miss Dad.
Where, the mall?
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
We have to stick with the plan.
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
You know what it takes.
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
I just want my life back...
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Just like that?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Will they?
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
The one you bought at school.
Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Are you mad at me?
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
Jim West.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
All what?
That's right... That's good.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
It's better than nothing.
It's a town!
What?  President Grant is...!
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
You are very important, Willow.
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
It's a matter of great importance to me!
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Too bad you're not more like your father.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
As above, so below.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Are you a warrior?
What is it?
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
What do I need for that?
Burn it to a fine ash.
What's the magician's weapon?
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
She's too powerful, Raziel
He never misses.
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Here.  Hold her.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
Oh sure, Fred.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
Maybe.
Who else knows?
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
You couldn't wait until morning?
But 
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
You tell him. When you're able.
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
What else can you do?
Not long... A few days.
Where's my baggy pants?
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
I don't know where he is.
I don't think she knows.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
If she...
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
How did you guess?
Oh -- yes.
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Oh...
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh! Oh!
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, come on.
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Um-hmm.
You're going to see a Wizard?
I don't blame you for that.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
Dorothy next!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
Here --   Come on.
Yes, you.
That's right.
Hold still - hold still --
Yeah --
Ohhhhhh!
Yes.
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
Oh --
Come on, fellows!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.
With this?
Then its no longer a bomb?
Makes her look even more innocent.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
James.  It wouldnt really be...
...yes?...
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Partially, yes.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
You, of course. I need some information.
Could...could you come?
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
What do you think?
Marvellous.
Its heading for the oil terminal.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
You're the only human being I care for.
Jon -- what??
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
And what if you¹re wrong?
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
Play one.  Educate yourself.
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
Where did he go?
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
What do you mean, frame-up?
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
Then why don't you ask him?!?
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
What is that ungodly smell?
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Yeah, I spy or I die.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Who says you're the good guys?
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
We hung out last night, remember?
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
You don't have to do that.
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
I'm through, Xander.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
What's the deal?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
Its core?
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
It's too far.
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
What if I like the pain?
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
He helped you?
I'll go.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
What do you want with him?
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
No!
Poppycock!
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
Yes.
Call me from New York before you leave??
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
May I have it, please?
I don't know what you mean, sir.
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
How old are you, young man?
But, sir...
But your grandfather's work, sir...
And do you also say Fro dereck?
What wockers?
Fro-derick!
Did you hear that strange music??
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
I have a pretty good idea.
If you like -- just hurry!
It wasn't me.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
Act casual!
How do you know it was a 'she'?
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
It's the only way.
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
What do you think we should do?
Yes, I will.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
His schwanzstucker.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Yes.
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
